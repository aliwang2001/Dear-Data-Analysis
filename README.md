# MSC website on GITHUB
A template for the website is here: [aliwang2001.github.io](https://aliwang2001.github.io)
(note: to make it as real as possible, I just added random blurbs of text and some nice pictures of caltech lol)
The MSC website will now be hosted on GitHub. This will allow everyone to be able to collaborate and help make the website amazing for the public. A copy of all website files will be on a folder in the server, and someone familiar with GitHub will update the website every week or so.

## Things you can do
* Add your contact card to the group page, optional info to display is picture, email, cell, or personal page
* Add your own, personal page, with functions such as displaying a bio, a calendar with your schedule, anything.
* Add a cool research article you found interesting on the home page and in the research archive.
* Add your own exciting research and present it through a slideshow.

No HTML/CSS experience necessary, all you have to do is follow the HTML template and copy/paste in the right location ^^
