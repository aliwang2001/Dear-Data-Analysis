While I am a sucker for slightly masochistic and obsessive data-gathering techniques, I accept that automation and ease will give me more time to do other things, such as actually have a life.I tracked when I checked the time, what type of clock I was looking at, and that\u2019s it.""}, {""header"": ""Data memories:"", ""content"": "" To neatly start the year-long project on the perfect starting day (Monday 1 September), the project started while I was holidaying in Greece.

Ouch.My favourite data point to track was when I was walking down the high-street in Totnes, hearing the church bell ring the time. Does it count as checking the time if the time is forced upon you? I\u2019ve decided it does.My first experience of a mild \u2018data void\u2019: I was at a wedding at the end of the week where we ended up in the sea after midnight, wandering through the dark. Drunk data-gathering is a challenge.""}, {""header"": ""Data drawing:"", ""content"": "" Due to this being the first card, I probably over-thought the design because I didn\u2019t want Giorgia to think my drawing was rubbish.

His response: \u2018Well, you\u2019ll be better after a year, right?\u2019Having said that, I like how this drawing looks. But data-wise, it\u2019s not very insightful: the data is difficult to read.But this is something that I\u2019m still undecided about: I\u2019m not sure whether or not to use the data as a starting point for a drawing where the focus is on the aesthetic, or to have the story told with the data be the main focus of these cards.

When I showed the complete drawing to my husband, he asked for a scan of the postcard so he could have a record for himself. I like how by gathering and visualising data about my relationship, the data becomes an emotional record, and becomes invested with quite an intimate meaning. By giving him the card I\u2019m effectively presenting to him a previously-invisible texture of our relationship, a data token of affection.But because of the intimate nature of the data I\u2019m tracking, it\u2019s made me think about what data about myself (and my husband, friends, and family) I\u2019m willing to reveal on the internet.\u00a0Obviously, so much of the physical contact I track is related to my husband, and of course, from marriage one can assume certain types of physical contact (ahem).

What I believe is that, to gain real meaning from these data sets, any self tracker should really focus and engage in a practice of sense-making, of interpretation\u00a0of those numbers according to one\u2019s personal story, behaviors and routine.And with Dear Data we are trying to work on it:\u00a0we like to think of\u00a0Dear Data as a \u201cpersonal documentary through data\u201d more than a \u201cquantified self project\u201d.\u00a0We think that collecting and aggregating personal data in these ways and\u00a0touching multiple topics and aspects can provide snapshots of\u00a0self-knowledge for ourselves and self expression towards the other person.      \u00a0\u00a0""}]"

I guess this is mainly due to being freelance and walking to work: my commute is shorter, so I spend less time crammed against someone on an overpacked train than I used to.\u00a0However, this decrease in spending time in groups is also\u00a0likely due to the fact that\u00a0I\u2019m becoming (slightly) more civilised, and instead of going out to bars and clubs with innumerable people all the time, I instead spend time with friends in smaller groups at people\u2019s houses, or stay in with my husband.But here\u2019s my favourite data memory that is evident in the final drawn card: Friday evening I was incredibly reasonable and well-behaved\u00a0and stayed at home to prepare for my conference talk while my husband went out to my friend\u2019s house party.\u00a0I was alone in the house all night, then woke\u00a0early to practice my talk, still alone in the house, and with a missing husband.

The whole thing reminded me of being in school and feeling that dull, lingering worry about not being cool enough or potentially being picked last for a team, though near the end of the week this feeling dissapated as I just savoured the kindness found in the compliments I actually did\u00a0receive\u2026 thanks, everyone!I did relatively well at tracking most of the week for compliments (though not very many, really) but then I had another data void that I\u2019m sure many UK people can relate to: the UK Christmas party season (I had three Christmas-themed parties to attend in 48 hours)!I\u2019m slightly worried that I\u2019ve had so many data voids and Giorgia hasn't, but I promise that I am relatively well-behaved. I think these \u2018data voids\u2019 are quite telling of me and my character: I like to record them, and I record them because they make me smile. I like chaotic events with crowds and music and these are generally quite difficult to combine with methodical data tracking. The \u2018data voids\u2019 function as a way for me to capture extreme, mostly-wonderful moments from my year (Except for one bad week, which you\u2019ll soon see).Although I did likely have less compliments because due to my data voids, I\u2019m not sure if the UK is really a compliment culture. When I lived in the US I would happily go up to someone I didn\u2019t know and tell them I loved their shoes, their hair, their clothing, and so on. However, here (and perhaps this is just in London) these types of compliments seem less accepted or less appropriate, and I\u2019ve slowly stopped complimenting people in this way, because it just didn\u2019t feel right. Other data memories include Giorgia manipulating the data, and my husband saying his usual drunken (but sort of lovely) \u2018I love yous\u2019 at the end of an alcohol-fuelled party evening.

I love how there always this human, kind, warm aspect to Giorgia's data that often I tend to overlook when gathering my own. I really like this drawing, I think this is one of my favourites. I like how the data, when drawn in this small, clustered way, feels as precious as you would expect a compliment would. I also noticed all of Giorgia\u2019s compliment\u2019s from Twitter/email about her work, and these are quite possibly some of the most lovely\u00a0compliments you could receive: there's always something nice when a stranger feels compelled to get in touch and let you know they enjoy what you\u2019ve made. I never compliment people in this way, and this is another reminder to do this more: it doesn\u2019t take much to let people know they are appreciated.

Firstly, I\u2019ve realised that it\u2019s important that all pieces in my wardrobe be wearable in a variety of situations. Before I went freelance, I dressed to look professional, and wore heels and lovely tea dresses in order to fit in at a publisher employing loads of impeccably-dressed women. However, since I've become freelance I\u2019ve become more relaxed about what I wear, and since my current studiomates are all men I don't feel the need to 'keep up' with them sartorially (sorry, guys).So since I don\u2019t have a work wardrobe that I need to maintain, I\u2019ve realised that I have selected most of wardrobe on the basis of whether the item of clothing is club-proof or not (not kidding). I like to have clothing that can survive anything from a three-day music festival in mud to a street party to a night out to just sitting on the grass in the park with a picnic, all while looking relatively fresh. In short, I like my clothes versatile. So no dry-cleaning, no crazy sequins or feathers that will fall off, nothing that you have to behave 'properly' in,, just good quality clothes that can handle life in a dirty city and being worn by a rather-clumsy wearer.And since we\u2019re here, one more confession: I keep most of my clothes jammed unceremoniously into a filing cabinet due to not quite getting around to buying a new wardrobe, oops.""}, {""header"": ""Data drawing:"", ""content"": "" I drew this in thin lines that reminded me of stacks of clothes...

To combat this I decided to take a pre-made dataset as a starting point, analysing my opinion of all the flavours \u00a0found in The Flavour Thesaurus, though I did end up adapting this dataset slightly. I think the reason that I found the data-gathering frustrating this week was that I\u2019ve realised that my favourite part of the project is how where we are lifting data textures \u00a0from the world to draw instead of shaping them ourselves. I think this interest might also be why Giorgia and I gather such different datasets, and mine are often less detailed: Generally, I just want to gather data from the world and that's it: I just want to capture this texture through creating a system of gathering this data, and setting this system running and then seeing what happens at the end. However, to me it seems that Giorgia will often incorporate data-gathering on her own feelings and reflections into her dataset, or her hand and personality are more evident in her data-gathering. What I\u2019ve finally realised is I think the difference in how we both frame the data-gathering is\u00a0that don't like to have that much of a hand in the data: I like to be on the outside, function as a sort of \u2018observing machine\u2019 who is counting what the world sends my way. (Giorgia, you'll have to let me know whether I'm getting it right here, or not!)""}, {""header"": ""Data memories:"", ""content"": "" This was a useful week in helping me realise that most of the foods that I dislike are foods that I first really ate in Britain or in Europe. When I was young, I was a fussy eater, though as I\u2019ve grown up I\u2019ve begun to eat most of the foods that I didn\u2019t like when I was young, even if I don\u2019t totally love these flavours.However, I\u2019ve noticed that since I\u2019ve lived in the UK I am keenly aware that people think that I\u2019m incredibly picky in regards to food, and this is something that I can find particularly stressful in regards to going over to other people\u2019s houses for dinner. Before going to someones for dinner I have to explicitly state that there are certain foods that I just cannot pretend to enjoy for the sake of being polite, no matter how hard I try. These foods include pat\u00e9, blood sausage, or any sort of offal in general, smoked strong-smelling fish like kippers and mackerel, fish roe, or extreme shellfish (oysters) or small fish (whitebait) that you swallow whole (all disgusting). The reason I have to mention these foods is that these are invariably the strange foods that are always\u00a0served at a dinner party, and this has always baffled me. I mean, why would you serve such strong-flavoured foods at a dinner party, if there\u2019s a chance that someone might not like these foods? I\u2019ve never understood this, as I would never serve these foods: they seem too much of an acquired taste to me. Then, it finally dawned on me: people serve these foods\u00a0at dinner parties because they assume that the flavours are standard across everyone's palates, and that everyone actually *likes* these flavours in the UK. (Crazy, I know. It took me a little while to actually get my head around liking these awful foods\u00a0as well)Of course! I didn\u2019t come across these sorts of flavours growing up in Colorado, hence why I don\u2019t like them: these are flavours I just haven\u2019t been raised with. In my data I highlighted the flavours/foods that I first really only tasted when coming to Britain, and it\u2019s evident that these are the foods that I generally like the least.

Would they think that I was crazy, or weird?

People are involved in every aspect of the journey, even though it feels like a private experiment between two friends (though of course, this definitely isn't the case now that we are publishing online).

Since we are expats\u2026 we decided to tell each other our relationship with our cities, in data. Oh gosh, so hard!\u00a0 I started by listing the places I feel at home at here in New York, the places that meant something important, and I added some dates to locate them in my mental timeline of the last year,\u00a0and I started pointing them\u00a0on the map. (For the record - I've been changing cities quite often,\u00a0I always and every time had the sensation that real life was elsewhere,\u00a0that I was kind of trapped in a place that was just not right.\u00a0Finally, and after changing 4 cities and 9 apartments, in 2012 I found New York.)BUT NO. I didn\u2019t want to do a perfect geographic map of my favorite venues: there is Yelp for it, or other kind of ways.\u00a0I wanted Stefanie to know my perception of the city, my image of the city. And here one of my favorite books from the past makes its entry:\u00a0Kevin Lynch's\u00a0\u201cThe Image of the City\"" In this book, Lynch elaborates on how people can orient themselves in urban environments by means of mental images: maps that are produced in our brains by combining immediate sensations and the memories of our past experience with that city or that area. In the book, he compares three American cities (Boston, Jersey City, and Los Angeles) and looks at how people orient themselves in these cities:\u00a0he\u00a0asks several participants to create a map of their cities as follows:\u00a0\u201cMake it just as if you were making a rapid description of the city to a stranger, covering all the main features. We don\u2019t expect an accurate drawing- just a rough sketch.\u201dLynch was interested in understanding how a city is easily \u201cimageable\u201d, which\u00a0is a term he invented to indicate how well a place can be taken in, mentally mapped, experienced; and \u201clegible\u201d: \u00a0where legibility means the extend to which the cityscape can be \u2018read\u2019.Lynch proposes that these mental maps consist of five elements: (1) paths: routes along which people move throughout the city; (2) edges: boundaries and breaks in continuity; (3) districts: areas characterized by common characteristics; (4) nodes: strategic focus points for orientation like squares and junctions;\u00a0 (5) landmarks: external points of orientation, usually a easily identifyable physical object in the urban landscape. Of these five elements, paths are especially important according Lynch, since these organize urban mobility.""}, {""header"": ""The image of my city"", ""content"": "" Long story short: I wanted to draw my image of my city to Stefanie. I went through his writings again, I wrote his main points in my Dear Data notebook, to process them in my own personal way; I spent some time looking at the examples he makes in the book and then I started to see my city in a totally different way for the first time: no perfect map below my favorite places, just my perception of the ways I go about walking in New York every day, with the mundane little encounters and memories. The funny thing is that I wasn\u2019t in New York while drawing this postcard, I was at my parents\u2019 in Italy: what better way to really \u201cimagine\u201d my city in my mind!  I start drawing a sketch map of my city without looking at any map, and placing geographic details as if I would have to describe them to a stranger\u00a0(or to Stefanie, of course!). I drew an imaginary daily trip: illustrating the sequences of events I would see, hear, and smell; selecting the most distinctive elements I could remember and recall. I walk the Williamsburg bridge every morning from home to work and, since when Stefanie was here in New York we walked the bridge together,\u00a0I decided to use the usual pink-muji-pen I always employ to indicate something related to Dear Data, to draw the path we covered together, as a reference for her to get around my postcard.

Coming from a smaller city like Denver, I am often taken aback at how quickly things change in a metropolis. Regardless, for this week, I thought that I would tell the story of \u2018my\u2019 London: that is, highlight important moments in my life through their location in this city, showing where I\u2019ve worked, lived, studied, and so on. ""}, {""header"": ""Data memories:"", ""content"": "" My main focus of how I shaped the data and the drawing for this card was to show how local my memories are in London: they are mainly centred around Brixton and Herne Hill, two communities next to each other in South London. While I\u2019ve lived very briefly in East London (which is where as a designer/creative I\u2019m obligated to go live in because everyone knows that artists are supposed to live East because it\u2019s trendy), I had a terrible houseshare experience there and ended up moving to South London 12 years ago to be nearer a friend, arriving at a ramshackle houseshare off Railton Road in Brixton and feeling like I was in the right place.And currently, I couldn\u2019t ask for a better place to be in this city: every morning during the week, I walk out of my house in Herne Hill and make my way up to Brixton via Railton Road, effectively walking by daily reminders of my past. I walk near to the open swimming pool that in previous times held all-night raves, and was where my husband and I first got together, then near the aforementioned Brixton houseshare where I first met my husband and some of my closest friends, and next, past the curious off-license where my housemates and I used to walk on hot summer days to buy single cans of beer because we were always skint (the shop has been converted into flats), past locations of previous pubs and erased clubs (now shops), past Brixton Market, past Brixton Recreation Centre\u00a0and its memories of the parties with massive dub soundsystems that would make the Rec\u2019s windows shake and reverberate, and then across the street to my studio. And because I come from such a new city like Denver, I\u2019m amazed at all the layered community memories I walk by on just one long street: past the first market street to be lit with electricity in the late 1800s (Electric Avenue), past old storefronts that used to be squatted by various activist groups (again, now flats), past previously-squatted houses turned housing co-ops (some still there, some sadly evicted by the council), past the scenes of the Brixton riots in the 80s, past locations of street-based squat parties in the 90s, and then past the contemporary memories, like the location of the annual summer street parties that are held in Brixton.I don\u2019t understand why I had to travel over an ocean and to another continent to find a place where I truly felt at home and felt proud to be part of a community, but there it is. I\u2019ve lived in my area of London almost as long as I lived in Denver when I was growing up, and I can\u2019t quite believe that soon this random location in a city across the world will be the place I\u2019ve called home for the longest.

This proved to be quite a challenge\u2026 how do you record something where over time, you begin to forget the fine details? As I grow older, things are starting to blur into each other, and it\u2019s hard to really know whether I am remembering things right or not, or whether my memories are actually my own, or were just picked up from photographs that were shown to me, or stories told to me by my parents. ""}, {""header"": ""Data memories:"", ""content"": "" First, I thought I would try to map my past by just focusing on key memories from my past that stood out for me. Here are a selection of these vivid memories below, shared because they are hilarious premonitions of the anxiety and questioning of my existence that I\u2019ve come to know and love in myself as an adult:Aged three? (Mom, I know you read this, so you can confirm my age with me): watching a cafe toilet overflow, being afraid that the entire cafe would flood and we would all wash away. This led to me flushing toilets, then sprinting out of the room so the toilet wouldn\u2019t suck me inAged four: sitting on the swing set in the back yard repeating to myself \u2018I\u2019m four\u2026 I\u2019m four\u2019, trying to understand the meaning of what being four exactly meantAged four or five: lying in bed, having an internal meltdown at the realisation that yes, I was going to die one dayAged eight, being woken in the night to see a lunar eclipse by my parents but not remembering it in the morning and mourning this memory loss for days and days afterwardOh, what an over-sensitive child I was.However, in the end I decided to focus on a more traditional way of describing the past: through linear timelines. I tried to create quite simple timelines of different key themes in my life that I thought would tell Giorgia something about myself, focusing on aspects of life that are quite revealing in regards to one\u2019s past: education, employment, location, clothing style, and so on, and tried to plot these different aspects of my life by year.This week\u2019s data-gathering was an interesting exercise in that I enjoyed seeing how my identity has changed over my life, though there is something slightly bittersweet about re-living some of the more difficult aspects of my past: the awkwardness of being a nerdy little kid, being teased and tormented in my boring Catholic high school, working in service jobs with no employee benefits and no respect, and so on. Though really, if I\u2019m honest: the negative aspects of my past are a small proportion. What really struck me about this week is that by gathering data on the different aspects of my past, effectively creating a \u2018CV\u2019 of my life, it\u2019s forced me to reflect upon where I\u2019ve come from and where I am now. I\u2019ve been privileged to grow up in a good family and get a good education, and so far, things have gone well for me, and I\u2019m thankful for this. If I died now, I\u2019d be happy with my life as it stands. Though often it doesn\u2019t seem that way, as I worry and complain alot, and often fret that i\u2019m not doing as well as I\u2019d like.

I think it makes the card confusing to read. This is another one of those drawings where the data is interesting but the visual outcome isn\u2019t very exciting. But how interesting can a card be when there are so many data categories? I guess I still need to figure out the right amount of data that offers both an interesting story for Giorgia to read as well as the right amount of data that offers lots of creative ways to draw it, but doesn\u2019t totally overload the card.

Of course, that\u2019s not the only way to be good to someone, and being kind involves more subtle interactions, such as listening, offering support, being present, and so on (ie like many of the actions Giorgia noted on her card, and like what I do on a regular basis, though unthinkingly). By comparing our methods of data-gathering, I\u2019ve realised that it will be difficult for me to feel as though I am a kind person if I\u2019m overlooking a wealth of kind actions that I do engage in\u00a0just because they aren\u2019t \u2018grand\u2019 enough.\u00a0Also, I\u2019ve noticed that I was equating buying things for other people as an act of kindness, when in reality, I don\u2019t actually base whether I think my friends and family are good people on whether they buy me something or not. It\u2019s interesting how when forced to confront these different internal rationales through gathering data on them, I often begin to notice that beliefs I thought were reasoned and well-thought-out are in many cases illogical.

Oh, how optimistic we were then, in those early days!However, I still like the idea of capturing these unusual datasets, as I enjoy how you can still see the story of a life lived in the most unusual types of data tracking. So, since we were both up for the challenge (and we like to make things difficult for ourselves), we set off on one of the most complicated weeks of data-gathering for the project. However, for my interpretation of this week\u2019s theme, I decided to flip things around a little bit, and focus on seeing doors as something that is dividing one space from another, so I chose to capture data on these partitioned spaces instead. ""}, {""header"": ""Data memories:"", ""content"": "" I noticed that for this particular week of data tracking, it was easier for me to store large quantities of data in my mind before needing to stop and note it down. Often, I can\u2019t pause and note data after every instance (particularly when other people are around, as they might think I\u2019m crazy or just really annoying), so I have to mentally store the data, then write it down later. For this week of data, I could easily look back and recall quite lengthy sequences of spaces I moved through through retracing and visualising quite clearly my movements in my mind.Reflecting upon this now, I suppose it makes sense that this week it was easier for me to retain this type of information, as the creation of \u2018memory palaces\u2019 has been a way of storing and recalling information in one\u2019s mind for aeons. I like this, as it\u2019s just another unexpected benefit of this year-long project: while of course we are slowly refining our data-gathering and data-drawing technique, I didn\u2019t ever realise that I would also find new ways of noticing, and remembering, and being aware of my life as I pass through it. ""}, {""header"": ""Data drawing:"", ""content"": "" This is quite a simple card, in that it is pretty much just referencing the idea of doors as a flat partition between two spaces, and, to be honest, has a level of complexity for a drawing that I could feel I could fit into my life for that (busy) week\u2026 I chose a less-complicated drawing option to cut myself some slack, since the data was more complicated. However, I do still like this drawing because it references tally marks, and I have a particular affinity for tally marks as an example of an ancient (but-still-in-use) system of notation and counting.With such a simple drawing approach, I focused my efforts on working with the colour palette more carefully than I normally do, clustering different types of spaces by colour so it was easier to see general patterns on the card. However, while I was drawing this card, I could see that it was difficult to differentiate between different tones of the same colour, so I started to add a texture of cross-hatching to some of the lines to \u2018fix\u2019 my card and make it a little more legible. As we\u2019ve moved through this year, I\u2019ve realised that I enjoy the spontaneous part of the drawing process, where I problem-solve as I draw, often changing my concept or adding different decorative elements, watching my card evolve in an unexpected direction. I know this is part of the process for a \u2018proper\u2019 illustrator, but for a data-centric designer who always plans everything in advance, i\u2019ve become more appreciative of having a chance to potter and play, and explore drawing in a more spontaneous fashion.So, imagine my frustration when the card didn\u2019t arrive in Giorgia\u2019s mailbox! I had to draw the whole card again, taking into account all of the spontaneous decisions that I had made before and re-drawing them relatively precisely: this wasn\u2019t as much fun, so I think from now on, if a card goes missing, we are allowed to refine and tweak the drawing slightly so the process is an enjoyment rather than a chore.""}, {""header"": ""Giorgia\u2019s card:"", ""content"": "" Of course, Giorgia never ceases to amaze me with the level of complexity of the data she gathers and draws. I love this drawing that Giorgia has created this week, it\u2019s so beautiful in its complexity, and while we both worked to the same theme, I prefer her card because it focused on the actual doors in such detail. Through this focus, this card draws my attention to a part of life that is so small, and mundane, and overlooked, and forces me to reflect upon it with fresh eyes. In my opinion, this is what a good artwork should do, and this is also why I work with data: to highlight the hidden patterns in parts of the world that often go unnoticed. This card is a definite favourite.However, I also remember her saying when I had received this card: \u2018I\u2019m so happy it arrived, so I don\u2019t have to draw it again!\u2019Ha, I wonder if her uttering those words jinxed us, and this was the reason that my card didn\u2019t show up, because of course one would go missing after someone said that, right?

In my life, I moved to different cities, and in 2012 I moved to a different country (and continent!); as a matter of fact I lost touch with some of my dearest friends from the past and\u00a0I made new friendships along the way.

The definition of a friend is quite complex, as how do you define a friend in the technological age, where a friend can be someone who lives in another country, or someone you\u2019ve never met in real life, but know in a digital space, either over email or on social media? Or how does one define a friend where you\u2019ve only met a few times, but are in contact very regularly through sending weekly data postcards to them? As you can see, it gets complicated, particularly because physical proximity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a close friendship. As a starting point, I created a list of criteria defining what a friend was, then also thought about the different roles that these friends had in my life.

Also, I\u2019ve that many of my connections are lived in a digital space where email, social media, video chats, and messaging create friendships that don\u2019t feel any less real for being lived virtually as opposed to physically, and I \u2018see\u2019 these friends more often than friends who live in London. For example, Giorgia is more present in my life than friends of mine who live only 10 minutes away: we message and email each other daily, and often chat over video.

I drew and re-drew this card, as drawing a radial diagram where all of the \u2018branches\u2019 of the tree diagram were evenly-spaced is beyond my drawing skill, and I ended up posting a card with a drawing that I was happy with, but still wasn\u2019t quite right: the branches still weren\u2019t evenly-spaced, but whatever, I needed to accept these imperfections and just send the card to Giorgia. So I posted this troublesome card, and then (of course) this card went missing. The universe is against me! (Or, ok, it\u2019s probably not the universe, but the fact that I always run out of room and start to write in the no-go zone on the postcard that actually is causing this problem)However, when losing the card, I felt relieved. I took this an an opportunity to refine my drawing skill and make my card better (particularly since I didn\u2019t want to just re-draw the same card, but try to enjoy the drawing process a little more by trying to build upon the previous design). However, I had the same problems: I still find it a challenge to draw evenly-spaced radial branches around a centre point. This must be some sort of special skill that an illustrator attains after drawing for one million hours or something, because it took me wasting multiple cards to even get something that would work. Illustrators, I bow down to you and your skill!Finally, since I re-drew the card a couple months after the original, I noticed that even in this short time period, the group of people I consider my friends has evolved. I ended up adding a couple of other friends to this card, or downgrading / upgrading the quality of friendship for some of my friends as well.

Unfortunately, while I agreed to this, I completely forgot to do any tracking at all, thus making this week the biggest data void of the project.\u00a0So, I had to find a solution, and the solution was to just look at what I consumed on the web browser on my phone and my laptop since I spend most of my time there during the week.Regardless of this week\u2019s massive \u2018data void\u2019, this data generally highlights the topics that I consume in the media: news, art & design, London, science, and so on. The only continual media consumption that is missing this week due to my forgetfulness is watching boxsets of TV shows and habitual reading of the Guardian on its app (likely not many books, which is slightly shameful, considering I used to work in publishing). However, I think this slightly-empty week of data is still a reminder that I tend to consume quite a narrow slice of media, focusing on the same content and sites repeatedly instead of broadening what I read. Perhaps I need to set myself a personal challenge of consuming different media sources every week for some variety. After gathering all this data, I tried to make the drawing look as detailed and aesthetically-pleasing as possible to detract attention from the flimsy data with the aim of focusing Giorgia\u2019s attention on the aesthetic first and foremost. I can\u2019t remember much from my experiences from this week since I completely forgot to track, right? But when I look at the completely-drawn card, feelings of stress, fear, and worry begin to flood through me. This was a time of year where I was pretty busy with work and finding it difficult to cope, and so because of this, I wasn\u2019t sleeping much and I kept forgetting things. [edit: WHAT? This was the week we launched dear-data.com? NO WONDER I forgot to track this week, and this week felt so busy and stressful! Currently kicking myself and laughing...]\u00a0Even when I don\u2019t technically represent this type of information in the card, the card becomes a physical marker of my memories, reminding me of what was happening in my life during the time I sent this postcard to Giorgia. I often find that working on a weekly project can be a challenge to fit into the rest of one\u2019s life sometimes. I fail at this often, but I don\u2019t mind too much: I\u2019m doing the best I can to regularly incorporate drawing and data into my daily life, and some weeks it\u2019s easier than others. I do think Giorgia is much better at time management than I am, so this is something that I need to get better at. As for Giorgia\u2019s card, her drawing this week seems to be a contrast to some of the previous drawings that were neatly-organised and more geometric. I like this more organic drawing, and it seems to allude more to the organic way that we consume media: it\u2019s something that happens slowly through the week, and the content winds itself around our minds and our actions for the week, sinking into our consciousness. I like how detailed Giorgia\u2019s card is this week as it sets the scene of her week in my mind, and I can imagine her in different locations, reading and passing articles onto friends or her boyfriend. My favourite part of the card is where she notes down that she was consuming an article while walking, as this is one of my (potentially bad) habits as well: I walk and scroll though my phone at the same time. However, before anyone says we are phone-addicted, I think this sort of behaviour is allowed when you walk long distances in a big city: walking is like driving a car, or riding on the bus: you end up multi-tasking!""}]"

After a week of being nicer, we decided on a simpler one: smiling to strangers! I tracked only my smiles to people I\u2019ve never met before:\u00a0not to acquaintances, not to waiters or waitresses or salesmen I was having any kind of interaction to, and not to people I engaged in a conversation with or that I\u2019ve been introduced to: I logged my smiles to perfect strangers.As for my weekly experiment, I was interested in seeing people\u2019s reactions to my performative smiles, so I also reported if they smiled back, if they didn\u2019t notice me and my smiles, if they pretended they didn\u2019t notice and looked away (and I had many of these ones!), and if they for some reasons smiled at me first.After my first 2 or 3 attempts to smile, I also realized my \u2018grins\u2019 came out not always the same, so I added a new category to my tracks: how was my smile? Was it a very good one? Was it genuine or maybe people could tell it wasn\u2019t?\u00a0 I unfortunately then had to add a couple of other categories: - I wanted to smile but was embarrassed, - I though I should smile but I just didn\u2019t because I was tired of tracking. In fact, as much it sounded very much fun in the beginning, it turned out to be incredibly hard and pretty exhausting towards the end of the week!!\u00a0 (One person stopping me after I smiled and asked \u201cdo we know each other?\u201d after that I considered to stop smiling alltogether)""}, {""header"": ""My smiley drawing:"", ""content"": "" Visually, I see smiles as a rounded entity, so I tried to work on this idea with my elements on my postcard.

I thought it was interesting to see if there were any differences in people I would smile to and in their reactions in different city districts. Every element is represented through the type of smile it was according to my categorizations, and feature some more details: the basic demographic of my stranger and some general information about what I was doing in that moment.

(Because - disclaimer - we never talk about what type of data to actually collect every week, we just agree upon a similar topic, and purposely leave the data gathering open to be interpreted by the two of us). The week after this, I found myself quite influenced by our performative smily week. Sometimes, especially the following Monday or Tuesday, and even if I was tracking a different topic, when encountering a stranger my head would automatically float up from the easier downward gaze and my lips hinted a grin. I found it to be a very nice - even if short - consequence of this week. I also reflected a little bit on the \u2018honesty' of my smiles: to produce a genuine smile I think we must authentically feel like smiling; to smile at a stranger in a real way requires to put together some kind of true feelings for them; or at least this is how I see it now and after this exercise. I found it easier to smile at good-looking people, for example (shame on me!), or at people who were wearing a relatively calm and positive face, or at people around my age and whom I could feel or guess had something in common with me. On a positive note, in many moments of this week, I sensed a sort of joy when my strangers smiled back at me, they felt like small and brief sparkles of happiness during my days, and I was wondering whether they felt the same.""}]"

I hated this week, because I don\u2019t like smiling at people in the street in London. Sure, smiling at people might be socially acceptable and encouraged in a smaller city, but if you smile at someone in London people will likely think that either 1: you are crazy or 2: you are hitting on them. This whole week I felt uncomfortable doing this, as though I was breaking into people\u2019s personal time, ruining their private moments they try to snatch for themselves in a crowded city. I didn\u2019t smile at everyone I met but just waited for a good opening to do so. But I felt so shy, regardless. However, this week\u2019s data-gathering experiment made me aware of the very transactional nature of communication and courtesy that there is in a big city \u2026 I saw a woman next to me in a shop pay for something and leave without even making eye contact with the person serving them, and it felt so clinical, and it made me hope quietly to myself that while I might be a little shy and reserved, I\u2019m not like that. Anyhow, I started to dread this task. And then on the Saturday evening I went to a show at Brixton Academy (Caribou + Koreless, in case you were wondering), where I made the total schoolgirl\u2019s error of drinking too much beer in a super-crowded venue of thousands of people where, of course, standing in the middle of the aforementioned thousands I realised I needed to pee. This then involved pushing my way through a croud of unmoving, unsmiling grumpy concertgoers just to make it to the ladies\u2019 toilet. I smiled the entire way, looking incredibly friendly and apologetic, yet was receiving no smiles in return from the hipster horde. At this point, I yelled \u2018screw all of you\u2019 to everyone in my mind, and ended the smiling project in protest. Sunday, I stuck to my protest and travelled to Cambridge by train and back, all the while luxuriating in the glorious feeling of being anonymous, settling back into my seat, and not smiling any anyone at all. It felt brilliant. However, while I disliked this week of data gathering / performance, in the following weeks I noticed that I felt less fearful about smiling at strangers. It\u2019s as though the terrible ordeal made me realise that it actually wasn\u2019t that difficult to just be a little more open and friendly, and that there was nothing to fear. This week\u2019s task has stuck with me, and now I actively enjoy smiling at people I am engaging with, trying to be more friendly (though I don\u2019t feel obliged to smile at those walking about the city in their own private worlds, as they are likely there for a reason).I knew that Giorgia would be better at this task than me, mainly because I am more willing to give up (as shown above) if something annoys me, whereas Giorgia is better at sticking to things. Anyhow, I am so impressed at how instead of tiptoeing around the project like I did she dove right in and smiled at lots of people I was too afraid to smile at. ""}]"

29,Week 29: A week of a boyfriend/husband,Stefanie,29_Stefanie_DearData_29+front.jpg,29_Stefanie_DearData_29+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""\u00a0A week of gathering data on our partners was always going to be be slightly questionable, as Giorgia and I both agreed that we wouldn\u2019t say we were tracking them in order to gather the most accurate data. Planning this secretive data-gathering in advance felt slightly unsettling. I chose to gather data on moments in the week where my husband inspired feelings of love in me, and moments where he inspired feelings of annoyance. Luckily for my husband, we were on holiday in Spain for much of this week, so I didn\u2019t have much opportunity to be annoyed by him while sipping glasses of sangria in the middle of the workday.And as I gathered up every \u2018feeling of love\u2019, I enjoyed how this action made me more aware of what makes me love my husband and how much I appreciate him, and how it also made me aware of how that which inspires \u2018feelings of annoyance\u2019 is often petty and inconsequential.Finally, on Sunday night, I knew I had to tell him about the data-gathering, because of course I needed his consent to use this data for a postcard. And while I told him, I felt almost sheepish, because I realised this could seem incredibly weird, and creepy, and you know... \u2018proper NSA like\u2019. I think he was ok about it, or at least pretended to be, though I think telling him that he had come off well with only a quarter of the final count being annoyances helped things. He gave me consent to use his data, but I still felt a strange shame about tracking someone without their approval. It didn\u2019t feel right, even though it was done out of love. On the following Monday after work, we were preparing dinner and he said to me that he was thinking about the previous week\u2019s data-tracking and that he thought it was quite sweet. I said, surprised: \u2018Really? I thought you might think it was weird.\u2019 And he replied: \u2018It is weird \u2026 But I kinda like it.\u2019And then I got a little teary, relieved at his response, and pleased that he knew I was tracking him out of love. And then seeing me crying, he called me a \u2018big softie\u2019, I laughed, and we resumed our normal, non-tracked marital life.This is surely evidence that data-stalking can be an acceptable way of showing love in our day and age, right? Hmm, I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but I think there is something interesting in how gathering data on emotional topics has a resonance to it. The resulting data has again become a love-letter to my husband. Through this project, I have started to attach emotional meaning to tracking and counting. By tracking my friends and my life, I\u2019m telling the people/places/things that I love that I notice them, and am aware of them. However, I\u2019m sure this type of tracking is more charming coming from me instead of one of the most powerful nations in the world, perhaps. One final note on my husband: as I read out to him all the times I felt feelings of love for him, his body came up the most frequently! Oops\u2026 I never realised how superficial I was, but can I help that I quite like the sight of my husband? Hearing this, he told me he hoped I loved him for his mind as much as his body (which I do, obviously), so I added a little red annotation to Giorgia highlighting his brilliance to even things out. Upon receiving Giorgia\u2019s card, I was pleased to see that we both tracked similar themes of love and annoyance. Also, I like seeing her drawing style evolve as she explores a more curved, organic aesthetic. But really, her postcard made me feel relieved, as I can tell by her card (and the resulting conversations we had after) that we have similarly-balanced relationships: we are both the often-grumpy, often-irrational half of the relationship, whereas our partners are the more calm, relaxed, and measured halves. I like this balance, because many of my closest girlfriends have similarly-balanced relationships, and so similar personalities to me, so this realisation has been nice to see that for all our differences, Giorgia and I come from the same sort of personality type, to some degree!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0""}]"

The only downside of the week was that I am quite aware I sounded like an melancholy amateur philosopher for most of the week, repeatedly discussing \u2018what it means to be alone\u2019 and loneliness with whoever I met. Sorry, everyone.Regardless, it was an enjoyable week of thinking how I define this state of being. In a big city, although one is never really alone, there are still spaces for solitude: you can be alone with your thoughts as you walk down a crowded street, for example, or when you stand wedged against 15 people on a crowded train, and that type of solitude is enough to draw upon when you need some time to reflect and relax.But in London, \u2018being alone\u2019 is more of a mental state as opposed to a physical state as it\u2019s the only way to find some peace and quiet in a busy city (and is also the reason I felt uncomfortable breaking into these self-imposed spaces during our week of smiling at others).However, while I decided to track these moments of being mentally alone in a crowd as well as moments of being physically alone, I also included moments when I am in my house, but my husband is asleep, and I am awake. As mentioned before, I tend to be an early riser: I get out of bed before my husband so I can get ahead to ensure that we will have the evening to spend time together and I won\u2019t be working late. I count this as being alone because while sleeping, he isn\u2019t aware of my presence in the same way he might be when he was awake. But while I was drawing this card, I realised I had made an error of data consistency: during Week 12, when we tracked the people in our vicinity, I didn\u2019t actually count myself as being alone when my husband was sleeping next to me. It\u2019s interesting how the same data is categorised in different ways depending on the theme of the data for the week: a reminder that so long as there are humans gathering and representing data, the decisions for organising this data will be inherently subjective. Finally, I also gathered data on when I felt emotionally alone: when I was lonely and sad. Philosopher\u2019s corner over, I gathered and drew my data for the week and was interested to notice that most of my time spent alone is generally time where I am doing something else, like commuting, or running errands in London. I have realised that although London is a city of eight million people, during the week it\u2019s mainly populated with a crowd of people who are mentally alone as they go about their day. We are all solitary, but we are solitary together, which seems to sum up London quite nicely.As for Giorgia\u2019s postcard, again, it\u2019s interesting that often without realising it we organise our drawings in a similar way, though I really enjoy how Giorgia has categorised her data this week, particularly because her data type \u2018alone and listening to the sounds of rain\u2019 is a perfect example of when being alone can be so satisfying and enjoyable. Giorgia\u2019s cards often feel more poetic than mine, and I envy this, because while I always try to create or capture a feeling with my design projects I don\u2019t think this emotional interest always extends to how I gather my data. I also am pleased to see that we both enjoy being alone: both of us highlighted times when we felt lonely, and these unhappy moments are a tiny sliver of the actual amount of solitary time spent this week. Is this because we are only children, so we don\u2019t mind being alone? Or because while living with a partner in a crowded city, we cherish those stolen moments of solitude? Of course, it\u2019s hard to draw conclusions from a week of data, but suffice to say that just by tracking this data, it\u2019s made me more aware and appreciative of these solitary moments whenever I find them.

This week, as soon as I realized that a lot of my positive entries were about my city, I started to pay more attention to the ambiance around me as I walked through my days,\u00a0and to how little details might impact my mood: the busyness, the lush of a nearby park, the smells, the buildings, and the general vibrancy of\u00a0the different people I walk past or I am surrounded by.Also, happiness to me has always been related to a sense of accomplishment: the ability to set goals for myself, achieving those goals, living in an atmosphere of overall growth and learning; and I know this is the foundation I need in order to function as a human being. But I probably don\u2019t acknowledge enough how it is important to find little things in our everyday life that can make us happier: sometimes also small facts can get a smile out of you. One of the most joyful record of my week, for example, is about me finding two rare Italian beauty products my mum and grandmother use in a little shop here in Brooklyn:\u2026a little expats joy that definitely made a good part of my day!Finally, the optimistic mood of this week of data naturally flooded into my following week: I definitely found myself stopping for a moment every now and then and actually letting the positive thoughts and the gratitude ones break in the stress - grumpiness, and mental to do lists that I was going through even after week 31! Yes, Dear Data reminds me more and more how the ability to be self aware and present is something you can exercise and learn!\u00a0""}]"

I gathered data on feelings inspired by people I know to strangers passing by on the street, or even inanimate objects such as ice cream (because it\u2019s the best thing ever), and was lucky enough to attend a wedding this week and track the feelings of goodwill I felt for the bride and groom.

32,Week 32: A week of sounds,Stefanie,32_Stefanie_DearData_32+front.jpg,32_Stefanie_DearData_32+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""I captured the sounds I heard in my vicinity evey hour while I was awake, enjoying this regular pause where I would stop what I was doing, sit quietly, and immerse myself into my soundscape. This week of data-gathering was particularly enjoyable because I've never examined my relationship with London through its sound.\u00a0One thing I realised is that some of the most regular sounds I hear come from the sky: the dull roar of airplanes overhead and birdsong.\u00a0I have a strange relationship with London birdsong, as it was one of the sounds that reminded me I was in a new country when I first moved to London over a decade ago. Hearing unknown tunes being warbled by British birds, not American ones, left me feeling slightly unsettled and acted as a subtle reminder that I was a long way from home.\u00a0As the years went on, birdsong would be connected to different experiences. The sound of solitary British birds singing as dawn breaks reminds me of how after staying out all night at a clubnight or a house party I would walk home\u00a0down empty, purply-blue-shadowed streets of terraced houses\u00a0with my husband or friends, with no one else awake to see the sun rise but us and the earliest birds.\u00a0And later, birdsong began to infuriate me, as I used to live in a second-floor flat next to a large tree, so the 'dawn chorus' sounded deafening and shrill.This anger at something as seemingly-innocuous as birdsong has been a running joke between me and my friends since one time I described how birds' 'screaming' would wake me up in the morning. Surely 'screaming' is the only way to describe how it felt to be\u00a0woken up by this aggressive chorus in high summer\u00a0at 4 am?\u00a0Now, I live in a little house at the back of a pedestrianised housing estate in London, and as you walk further from the street, the typical 'London' sounds begin to melt away. While I live relatively central, finding this relative silence feels like a luxury.\u00a0Birdsong, airplanes, and the quiet whoosh and rattle of a commuter train passing on the tracks by my house are an unlikely combination of sounds that to me signify relaxation, solitude, and home. When I tracked these sounds this week, I felt comforted.\u00a0It took this week of careful listening to make me realise that now I find birdsong quite soothing, at it reminds me of being at home and at rest. Maybe it's also a reminder of how time has passed, and how as I grow older even sounds begin to take on new meanings as the years go by.\u00a0This week, I drew a card filled with little scribbles to allude to the textured sonic waveforms, and divided these sounds between organic sounds and mechanical sounds.\u00a0Giorgia's card this week is again one of my favourites, as referencing musical notation makes perfect sense here. Also, the way she was able to separate the soundscape into different layers of intensity reminds me again that I will never be as good at creative and evocative data-gathering and categorisation as she is! Case in point: she gathered data on the 'digital sound of the rain', which has got to be the most poetic data category we've had this entire year...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0""}]"

Anyone who knows me well knows I am often lacking in confidence, particularly when it comes to my design work. I have a massive case of impostor syndrome, and at art events filled with such talented, inspiring people, it\u2019s very easy to get that sinking feeling of worry in my chest, feeling as though I somehow snuck into this other world and didn\u2019t really belong. I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, so perhaps this is the reason I am often envious of other people's 'perfection', but having these feelings is a hard habit to break. Although I wasn\u2019t looking forward to this week, I was still interested in confronting these feelings head-on.Unfortunately, I noticed that tracking such negative data affected my mood, often reinforcing the feelings in my mind as I spent additional time noting these negative feelings down. And I also noticed that while I was attending the arts festival, I felt more envious of the excellent artists and designers and friends around me before I gave my talk, but once the talk was over (and I was sure it was a success), my envious feelings faded. I see how clearly my envy is related to feeling confident in my abilities and feeling secure in myself. So long as I do a good job, I feel safe from these bad feelings (so maybe this is why I\u2019m a perfectionist, then, as a preventative measure?)I liked the drawing this week, because I wanted to show how reasonable situations this week (the circles drawn from pen) were destroyed by moments of envy (the scribbled, messy colours). With this drawing I felt happy, as I felt like I was progressing with my drawing skills to some degree.However, these good feelings faded as I read the main types of envy I had out loud to my husband. Verbalising these feelings starkly highlighted how awful and irrational many of these feelings are, and also, how embarrassing. This was the first time in a long time that I\u2019ve had to take notice of such awful thoughts, and while I still think it will be difficult to shake them, I like how having a permanent record of this envy in the form of a postcard means that I won\u2019t be able to ignore these thoughts so easily in the future. When I received Giorgia\u2019s card it was interesting see how our feelings of envy point in completely different directions, though perhaps my envy was skewed due to being at the aforementioned arts festival for part of the week. I knew that Giorgia is always working to refine her English skills, but I never thought that she would actually have feelings of envy, and I wish she didn\u2019t have them: speaking as an American with poor language skills (ok, I know some French but I couldn\u2019t tell a rude joke in it) I am always amazed that she can run a business, give talks, write Dear Data postcards, and explain the finer technical details of data visualisation in a second language! If anyone has a reason to be envious, it\u2019s me: surely having to learn a language alongside living your life at the same time is a pretty spectacular feat to pull off...""}]"

And I also reported when the dog was wearing a coat (!), or was wearing tiny shoes (!) or it was sitting in a bag (!).Immediately on Monday, I also realized I could include when I heard birds singing in my collection, and I recorded it as well along with the intensity and duration of their chirping.When I was fast enough, I also took pictures of my animal-spotting because I wanted to give Stefanie a real idea of what New York animals (i.e. dogs) look like!(Luckily for me, only one rat (but a big one!) crossed my path during this week, probably because I didn\u2019t take the subway at all, that is where it\u2019s most likely to be approached by a mouse around here).\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""The most shameful revelation within Dear Data so\u00a0far"", ""content"": ""My boyfriend and I don\u2019t have a dog, and probably never will, but we like small dogs (even if I am a cat person I guess), and we have \""our dogs that belongs to others\u201d.

For example, little Jack Russels\u2019 name is, of course, Poldo; Dachshund\u00a0puppies are named Piero; thin Greyhounds\u2019 name is Lattuga, and so on.Okay, yes, this is very embarrassing, but in the spirit of this week, I couldn\u2019t help but adding this notes to the logs when one of my spotted-dog was a \""Piero\"", or a \u201cMartino\u201d etc. And, as we pointed out already, the more we get into Dear Data the less afraid of sharing personal details we are; it is just fun!""}, {""header"": ""Collaborative data counting"", ""content"": "" Apparently my boyfriend loved this week as well. One morning in the beginning of the week when I got to the office he asked me \u201cSo, how many dogs have you spotted on your way? I got 5!\u201d He was tracking as well!

In the postcard\u2019s layout I grouped my animals in areas according to their type. Dogs of course take the greater space and the majority of visual attributes. The color of the elements in the postcard represents more-or-less the principal color of their fur, to give Stefanie a visual summary of my animal spotting.I LOVE Stefanie\u2019s card, it is definitely one of my favorite, I like how she organized the architecture of the visualization around where she saw the animal, radiating outward from where she lives, and I generally like her drawing very much! I also learned loads of new animals names in English thank to her postcards! I had absolutely no idea what a parakeet, or a sea-gull, or a magpie was and I had a lot of fun looking them up on the dictionary!""}, {""header"": ""The week is now my time-unit"", ""content"": "" This week I realized very vividly how much, so far, the \u201csmallest\"" unit of time I experience is the week, it\u2019s like the \u201cday\u201d no longer exists in my visual timeline of my past and my future. A week is marked now by its topic, by the Sunday morning drawing, and by the ritual of posting my card, it is so neat in my mind! It\u2019s like keeping a diary with a weekly pace,\u00a0where the timespan and the time-unit of the week helps telling your story not as \u201cimpulsively\"" as in a daily-diary report;\u00a0and the (sort of) \u2018objectiveness\u2019 of the data we collect helps understanding what is happening to us and around us on a deeper and definitely more thorough way than a regular diary.(Or, am I just crazy?)""}]"

This week posed a particular data-gathering challenge: I was training for a long cycling trip so I was going out on my bike often, spotting animals on two wheels instead of two feet. This made it slightly challenging to record data: you can't stop and gather data every time you see an animal or you wouldn't even pedal down the road. Instead, I had to try to remember long strings of animals in my head, repeating them in my mind over and over until I had a chance to stop and record them all. So in my mind I might repeat over and over:'Pigeon dog pigeon seagull\u2026 pigeon dog pigeon seagull\u2026 pigeon dog pigeon seagull\u2026 pigeon dog pigeon seagull\u2026 pigeon dog pigeon seagull pigeon!... Pigeon dog pigeon seagull pigeon...Pigeon dog pigeon seagull pigeon...Pigeon dog pigeon seagull pigeon...Pigeon dog pigeon seagull pigeon dog!'and so on, continually adding to my internal animal list until I was able to stop and record my data. This was a slightly-maddening process, and so was one of the first instances where tracking data impacted my ability to have a good time. While in other situations tracking data made me more aware, here the data tracking is getting in the way of me enjoying the feeling of freedom and relaxation as I pedal through my city (and might potentially prevent me from properly noticing cars, pedestrians and the like, oops). Also, on the weekend, my husband and I cycled to the London countryside (thank you, husband, for helping me spot all the rare birds) and often I was so pleased to spot new animals that I was calling out \u2018horse!\u2019 or \u2018wood pigeon!\u2019 quite loudly while riding down country lanes. Of course, this conveniently always happened at the same a pack of lycra-clad cycle ninjas would speed past me up a hill\u2026 I can only imagine what they thought of the crazy cyclist yelling \u2018horse! HORSE!\u2019 as she faded in the distance, steadily and slowly pedalling in their wake.Finally, this week was a turning point for me in regards to how I think about the data we collect. No matter how hard we try, we will always be unable to gather a scientifically-accurate dataset due to data voids, or forgetting to track, or just because we are human, and so very, very\u00a0imperfect.Instead, these cards really just function as the an accurate record of my and Giorgia\u2019s \u2018noticing\u2019 of the world around us, and being aware of our surroundings. And now that I realise this, I feel more relaxed about my data-gathering: I will do my best to notice what I can, but won\u2019t be worried if life / distractions / daydreaming mean I might miss a few things from time\u00a0to\u00a0time.This week was a great postcard to receive from Giorgia as well: I didn\u2019t realise how many dogs she would see, and how pampered these dogs were, with their clothing and their little carrying boxes and so on. As a Londoner, this feels distinctly \u2018New York\u2019 to me: dogs in London feel rougher, and bigger, and just not as spoiled (though this could be because of where I live, perhaps in fancier neighbourhoods it\u2019s slightly different!)""}]"

Stefanie and I only met 3 times at this point in real life, and the majority of those times we were at conferences or at organized events, thus probably wearing more elegant attires than on our normal days, so we decided to give each other the idea of how we look like from day to day, in data and drawings.I reported every time I would change my clothing during my days from when I woke up, and every time I would put a coat, a beret or a scarf on and off. (I also started my week taking pics of my outfit every morning, but then I felt stupid and I just stopped!) It was the beginning of May, definitely still pretty chilly here in New York, and I am a very cold person, so my data doesn\u2019t really reflect a typical \u201cMay\u201d apparel!""}, {""header"": ""Outfit drawings"", ""content"": "" In my drawing, I organized my data chronologically, to give Stefanie the picture of my week in dresses. Every vertical line indicates a type of garnment I wore, defined by their symbols: underwear, socks, bra, undershirt, longsleeve, sweater, turtleneck, shoes, pants, scarf, jacket, beret.\u00a0(for some reasons I didn\u2019t do anything fancy this week but I mostly just worked, so I didn\u2019t wear any dress or skirt!)The color of the lines represent the actual main color of what I was wearing, and I drew some attributes to recognize those who had stripes or patterns.\u00a0The lenght of the lines then, is the \u201camount\u201d of time I had that clothes on during the day. Since many of my dress-changes happened after a shower, of course, I indicated it as well.This week Stefanie and I produced two incredibly similar drawings in terms of how we discerned our data: she also gathered data on every wardrobe change, ordering her changes chronologically, dividing per days and per hour. How many different clothes she wears! I am such a routinary person! (I am laughing at her legend and notes about her imperfections, it is so sweet! :))""}, {""header"": ""insights?"", ""content"": "" What does this week teach about us? For sure, as I realized multiple times, I have sort of a problem with my wardrobe, as I guess probably lots of women especially have. (?) I have lots of clothes, nice clothes, nice dresses; but I really end up wearing always the same comfortable kind of pants, shirts and sneakers. I just love feeling comfortable and not tight-up in confining dresses. But then why do I keep on buying new fancy stuff?\u00a0 I am ambivalent about my relationship with my outfit: from the one hand I love feeling casual and loose; but from the other (and as it\u2019s visibile in my week of envy) I do like so much women who look elegant, and I do take pleasure when I finally decide to dress up a bit! I am pretty sure this is a very common sensation? But this week left me with questions more than any kind of answers!""}]"
35,Week 35: A week of getting dressed,Stefanie,35_Stefanie_DearData_35+front.jpg,35_Stefanie_DearData_35+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""This week I was going on holiday to spend a long weekend\u00a0cycling through the Netherlands and Belgium, and I knew I would be on my bike most of the day. Because of my difficult experience gathering data on last week's\u00a0cycle rides, I needed to find a type of data-gathering that would suit cycling and wouldn't ruin my enjoyment of the holiday. So, a week of wardrobe changes was perfect for this week of cycling for two reasons: firstly, there\u2019s a pretty slim chance I\u2019ll be undertaking any major wardrobe changes while riding a bike (alas, I\u2019m not that skilful) and secondly, I thought it would be fun to capture the variety of different technical garments that cycling requires for Giorgia. Through the week, I noted down every single wardrobe change, even counting the towels I wrapped around just-washed hair when I stepped out of the shower, or times when I was completely naked (moments with no wardrobe are slightly hidden in the card, I really ought to have made these stand out a more in my drawing)I liked this week, as it made me look more closely at a part of life that has become second nature, and has also highlighted parts of my wardrobe where I might consider adding some variability (ie perhaps I really need to stop finishing my outfits with black tights and black trainers for a change, since I seem to wear them every day!)However, I was mainly excited to get to the weekend, when my cycling holiday arrived and I gathered data on all the strange attire I was wearing, such as padded cycling shorts (so you don\u2019t get a sore bum, of course), helmet, cycling gloves, exercise gear, waterproofs, and so on.To be fair I didn\u2019t really have that much technical clothing; I prefer to be a slightly incognito cyclist by hiding most of my gear under more normal-looking clothes and never wear athletic shoes, only black Vans. I do this to because I dislike cycle bores who drone on about their technical gear (if any of my friends read this, you know who you are, ha), so I try to be discreet. While drawing this week, I decided to set myself a challenge to create a drawing with more of the rigour found in my professional data projects than I have on some of the other weeks of Dear Data, where I normally use the data as a structure with which to experiment with different drawing approaches. I organised the garments according to where they are worn upon the body and also tried to colour-code these garments in rough \u2018warm/cool\u2019 groups to create a more formal logic for my colour choices. Because of all this pre-planning and the sheer amount of wardrobe changes, this card took me ages to draw. I think I experienced something similar to Giorgia\u2019s plight while drawing her \u2018Doors\u2019 postcard, repeatedly looking at the spreadsheet, drawing the data, looking at the spreadsheet again, finding a mistake I can just about resolve, looking at the spreadsheet again, all the while praying to the universe that I don\u2019t make a mistake and have to start over. By the time I finished the drawing and began to fill out the legend, I was so sick of the process that I was writing the legend in haste while listening to music, which made me distracted and I made some terrible mistakes that sent me in a panic because they were unfixable. I had to cut and glue another piece of card down to cover up these mistakes up\u2026 not ideal, but prevented my from throwing all my drawing materials through the window. And Giorgia\u2019s postcard reminds me that we are opposites in regards to clothing: I mainly own black or dark clothing, while Giorgia wears white often. And I am reminded of how Giorgia says she gets cold easily, as this is evident in this postcard through the multiple layers of clothing that she keeps on throughout the day, even in springtime!Finally, I am able to get an idea of her fashion sense through this card as well (while we have met, daily fashion is hard to spot through messages, emails and video calls): she wears turtlenecks and berets, two articles of clothing that I don\u2019t own and generally wouldn\u2019t wear. I enjoy how by focusing on gathering data on the mundane and routine aspects of our lives we likely tell the other more about ourselves than if we tried to gather more \u2018exciting\u2019 data.

During these days I felt so poor, miserable, useless and selfish that I really wish I decided to go. It was very painful, I will never see him again, I could have seen him once more; and - most of all - he could have seen me once more.So, I felt incredibly undecided whether to go or not before he passed away, and immensely ambivalent on how to feel after that, later in the week. How do I feel about my family? About living so far away and knowing that I can\u2019t be always there for emergencies?\u00a0 How do I feel about my loss, about the fact that I won\u2019t see him again, can I really be relieved he\u2019s not suffering anymore or am I just selfishly sad about how much I will miss him?I found this week being the most intrusive, since when we started Dear Data, I was dealing with my life hesitancies and I had to focus on them very badly since I needed to record them.I was really overwhelmed, but at the same time now I see my postcard as a sort of homage to his memory, and to my particular struggle in dealing with our distance and our missed goodbye.I also talked to Stefanie about my situation during a call, and we shared the inner conflicts of being expats regarding these moments, I think we felt close. \u00a0""}, {""header"": ""My drawing"", ""content"": "" I drew my indecisions dividing them according to whether I came to term with them or not: did I solve it immediately?

36,Week 36: A week of indecision,Stefanie,36_Stefanie_DearData_36+front.jpg,36_Stefanie_DearData_36+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""I am an indecisive person, and always worry and fret when I make the wrong choice. This indecisiveness latent in my personality is why, as a designer, I have chosen to mainly work with data as my design material: by systematically following a set of rules in order to present data visually, this process prevents moments of indecisions from happening: I just follow the design rules, and create the final piece without having to worry about having to make spontaneous aesthetic decisions. I like the comfort of knowing I am following a path where I don\u2019t need to make very many choices as I go.But of course this indecisiveness is found in every aspect of my life, not just design. To track these feelings, I first decided (amazingly, I made an ACTUAL decision) that selection, where one is weighing up two (or more) options and then selecting the most appropriate one is different than actual indecision. Indecision is more about the feelings of stress and worry associated with the selection process. It\u2019s inherent that we will have to make choices in our lives, no question, but some people do it effortlessly, whereas other people (like me) stress, and fret, and worry about whether their decision is the right one, and it\u2019s these moments of stress that I chose to collect. It\u2019s difficult to track moments of indecision because these feelings can be so subtle and second-nature, but I managed to capture a few. I captured standard moments of indecision, such as worrying about what to wear, about friendships, or about work. However, there are two common indecision situations (and the resulting indecisive feelings) that often come up frequently in my life, and probably say something about me to Giorgia!The first is \u2018party indecision\u2019, which is a form of indecision that is quite specific to London due to the early closing times of the London Underground. This indecision happens when at a house party or a club, generally on the other side of London from home. It generally involves lots of worry as the clock nears midnight, where I can\u2019t decide whether to take it easy and just have a couple drinks, then get the last train home with no hassle, or stay out later and havea bit of a dance and a party, then miss the last train and plant to take an expensive cab home, counting and calculating whether or not there are enough people to split the cab fare, or whether you\u2019ll be ponying up the \u00a340 on your own. Or, do you decide to just sack off the whole decision-making process and just STAY OUT ALL NIGHT until the trains start running again in the morning? (this final decision happens less these days, I\u2019ll admit) The second is \u2018food indecision\u2019: I find it near impossible to order in a restaurant without getting quite stressed, because I\u2019m worried about ordering the wrong thing and having \u2018meal envy\u2019 of my fellow diners. This is compounded by the fact that my husband seems to have a special knack of always ordering something amazing off the menu, so I spend most of my time trying to decide whether I should just order what he is having so I don\u2019t regret my own choice, or whether I should just go with what I wanted in the first place. And of course, I always have regrets in regards to this type of decision, as evidenced by my postcard: only one moment of regret this week, and it was because I ordered the wrong thing in a restaurant.While drawing this card, I tried to illustrate indecision with a scribbled line, and used a straight line to signify that a plan of action was decided. However, I kept my dataset quite simplistic, so it was a joy to receive Giorgia\u2019s card, as it has so much data that I wouldn\u2019t have thought of capturing. I think this week is another one of my favourites because of how much information Giorgia was able to compress in such a small postcard. Also, I like this card because, through messaging each other, I knew that Giorgia was deciding whether to go home or not to see her grandfather. You can see that this was the biggest decision in her life this week, one that also affected the decisions of how she felt about herself, which is quite poignant and melancholy when you realise this, and it's a set of feelings I can empathise with: my grandfather passed away last year, and I had to make a similar decision to travel from the UK to the US to see him in hospice, and attend his funeral. These are the decisions that expats or people living away from their families have to make all the time, but it doesn't make them easier.\u00a0I like this card because it\u2019s honest and open in a very special way, one that will make this particular card a remembrance of a specific moment in time for Giorgia once we swap all of our cards back to each other at the end of the project.

So, as I\u2019m sure you can imagine, I was incredibly-excited for this week of data-gathering to commence. This week of swearing wasn\u2019t meant to be performative, but I may have made it more of a performative week because I used this excuse of data-gathering as free reign to swear whenever and wherever I wanted, savouring every time a swear word left my mouth. And I liked saying words that I really only began to use once I moved to Britain, such as the milder word \u2018twat\u2019, or its more offensive cousin \u2018c*nt\u2019: these are my favourite words to yell at the television, or yell about politicians while I read my weekend paper. While these words are some of my favourites, it\u2019s obvious from my postcard that the front runner in my week of swearing is \u2018f*ck\u2019 simply because it\u2019s a versatile word that can be used in a myriad of different contexts. Also, I see I mainly swore in front of my husband, and this makes sense, as we obviously have a close relationship where it\u2019s acceptable: while I love to swear, I still follow social convention (don\u2019t worry, Mom!) and rarely swear in a more formal or professional situation unless the people involved are my close friends. Also, the context for my swearing is generally just teasing, friendly banter as opposed to an insult.But while I love swearing, I am still a little wary of posting my usual swear words online for all to see, particularly my family (hi guys) and particularly Americans, as I know that \u2018c*nt\u2019 is definitely considered beyond the pale in my home country. Sorry, everyone, but I will promise I won\u2019t ever to never use that word in front of you, or about you!Giorgia\u2019s cards are always exciting to receive because she always explores the data-gathering from an angle that I would have never thought of, and she didn\u2019t fail me this week: I really loved how she gathered data on the swear words she heard in the air around her as well as the ones she said herself, which feels quite poetic, even if only on the topic of swearing.

38,Week 38: A week of negative thoughts,Stefanie,38_Stefanie_DearData_38+front.jpg,38_Stefanie_DearData_38+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""Well, this is a cheery week to write about, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not really sure why Giorgia and I take pleasure in gathering data on these slightly-depressing parts of our lives, but I guess that\u2019s the point: by tracking the times when we are thinking negatively, we will be forced to notice our behaviour patterns and reflect upon it. Anyone who knows me (and I\u2019m sure that Giorgia is pretty aware of this by now), I am a very pessimistic person. I tend to think the worst about everything, and it\u2019s easy for me to get stuck into downward spirals of worry and despair that cast every aspect of my life in a bluish, subdued tint.I think I like to wrap myself up in pessimism and negativity as a way of protecting myself: if I think the worst, then I can\u2019t be disappointed if something doesn\u2019t go as planned, because I knew it wouldn\u2019t in the first place, right? I\u2019ll admit this isn\u2019t exactly the ideal way of coping with life, and there are more positive ways to deal with uncertainty, but I find it hard to break this habit.Because of this, I was worried about this week of data-gathering because (as I saw during our week of envy) focusing on negative thoughts can often make me feel worse. So, as a precaution, in my data tracking I tried to balance each negative thought with a positive thought to prevent me from tumbling into a pessimistic gloom.Also, I tracked where I was directing this negativity: to myself, or to the outer world? I tend to be quite hard on myself, and I find it quite difficult to \u2018love\u2019 (ha, we are descending into self-help-speak here) or feel confident about myself, so I was curious to see where most of my negativity was directed.This was another week where I spoke about my work at a conference, just like our week of envy. I noticed a similar pattern with these thoughts like the last week I was speaking at a conference: I had loads of negative thoughts before I spoke, then after I spoke about my work, I felt less negative. I can tell I'm trying to protect myself with pessimism:\u00a0thinking the worst just in case my talk is unsuccessful.While I tried to combat negativity with a positive thought, soon I gave up and just wallowed in these depressing thoughts, feeling quite miserable, actually. The very act of capturing and filing away these thoughts seemed to amplify these feelings and hold them in my mind for longer. Now, looking over the collected data, we have an (obvious) winner: of course I directed most of my negativity toward myself! No surprise there. \u00a0I think the problem with this type of negative-data-tracking is that the outcome of looking at the dataset is to reinforce the bad feelings instead of offer one insight on how to overcome these feelings. Looking over this data is difficult.\u00a0I\u2019m not sure if I would really want to track these sorts of topics again, as I think they do more harm than good.Finally, I've noticed that my inward-looking negativity is different to Giorgia\u2019s negative thinking, which (from looking at her card) tend to be mainly directed externally as opposed to internally. Through this project I\u2019ve always envied Giorgia\u2019s confidence, particularly when it comes to her work, and wish that I could be the same way where even during bad times (like Giorgia had during this week) I would be able to cope without continually focusing my negativity upon myself.Now, for one positive thought (FINALLY): I quite liked drawing this card, and I\u2019m pleased with the outcome. That\u2019s good, right? Another positive thought: this was a special postcard, as it was hand-delivered to Giorgia when I met her in Minneapolis, hooray! (more on this next week)""}]"

39,Week 39: A week of beauty,Stefanie,39_Stefanie_DearData_39+front.jpg,39_Stefanie_DearData_39+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""Tracking places where we found beauty seemed a natural way to counteract the sad feelings that were amplified by a week of tracking negative thoughts. It makes sense that beauty / a pleasing aesthetic is important to both of us, as we spend our working life trying to create things that are both beautiful and functional, and so we\u2019re always looking for aesthetic inspiration in the world around us.I enjoyed this week because it made me realise how small pleasures can make an massive impact on one\u2019s day or mood. I gain a disproportionate sense of joy from simply seeing something with a pleasing visual aesthetic, so in a way, it\u2019s almost as though I am getting something lovely for nothing, which is a nice thought\u2026.I should appreciate these small things more often. This week also surprised me because I was reminded of how much I appreciate beauty found in nature now, which is very different from when I was growing up in Colorado. Ever since I was a teenager, I\u2019ve always told people that I \u2018hate nature\u2019, and it\u2019s become a running joke with my friends and husband. I\u2019ve always said I \u2018hated nature\u2019 because I didn\u2019t feel suited to living in Colorado with its range of mountains to the west, complete with a photogenic view at every turn of a mountain road. While my friends growing up were hiking, skiing, or snowboarding in the midst of this beautiful scenery, I tried to be different by distancing myself from this scene and was much happier to spend my time in a dark, sticky-floored club or concert venue instead of out under a blue sky. I counted down the days until I could move away to live in a metropolis forested with skyscrapers, not trees. Moving forward to my life in London, and as I\u2019ve grown older, my \u2018hating nature\u2019 stance has softened slightly. Flowers appeal to me in particular, especially in the summer. I walk through my estate every day (I live on a pedestrianised housing estate connected with footpaths that weave through clusters of houses strewn with little gardens and green squares), and I specifically choose certain paths through the estate that have the most beautiful flowers on display. I\u2019m not quite at the stage of becoming an avid gardener (I might be too impatient/lazy), but I take pleasure in having flowers around me\u2026 such a domestic, mundane interest would come as a shock to my teenage, anti-nature grumpy self. Resting one\u2019s eyes on natural beauty is a way of relaxing in a busy city, I guess, and I\u2019ve become more interested in the natural world as a contrast to the hard urban environment that I\u2019ve lived in for more than a decade. Another part of this week that I found interesting was how I often took a second look at people with red hair\u2026 this is because my husband has red hair, so I see it as a sign of beauty and I find it striking because seeing red hair always reminds me of him. However, being married to a man with red hair does make it much easier to spot him in a crowded room, so perhaps that\u2019s the reason for my reflexive glances: I keep thinking the red-haired people are my husband!At the end of this week of tracking I caught a flight to Minneapolis where Giorgia and I were to meet for the first time since I saw here in NYC in October, and afterwards I spent time visiting my family outside Chicago, which meant that this week was the first postcard I drew in my American homeland. I was hanging out in my Grandmother\u2019s house, trying to draw a postcard on the bed of my father\u2019s teenage bedroom and getting stressed out in that special sort of way that only happens when you are surrounded by your parents and family and you revert to being a surly 16-year-old teenager again. This is the reason that this card is so simple in design: anything more would have resulted in a teenage-style temper tantrum as I tried to draw a postcard under such circumstances.And again (and I know I say this often), this is another one of my favourite cards of Giorgia\u2019s, particularly the part where she found her teddy bear to be beautiful, ha. Though honestly, I really just like that we both said that we found our postcards to be beautiful: this is gratifying, as when we started this project we had no idea what we were doing and this is a sign that we are gaining confidence, we\u2019re getting somewhere...""}]"

This was the second time we\u2019ve met in person since we started the project and it felt great to disembark from my plane, travel to my hotel and then directly meet Giorgia and her boyfriend for dinner and a beer.We were excited to be in Minneapolis for two reasons: firstly, we were going to be opening the festival by publicly speaking about Dear Data for the first time together, and secondly, because we both received delivery of some precious cargo that the other carried with us to Minneapolis: we did a swap of our postcards, and it was so great to say hello to my postcards to Giorgia after not seeing them for so long, and interesting to see how their journey to New York left its mark on them. We both decided that since we would be meeting so many people this week it would be nice to gather data on the people we met, both new and old.However, we may have made things slightly difficult for ourselves in regards to this data-gathering task when, at the end of the talk, we told the entire festival population that we were tracking people we met, and invited them to come and say hello to us. The entire festival audience was in attendance, so over 500 people, and it was literally five minutes after we finished our talk that we realised what we had done when tons of people came up to us and started introducing themselves as we furiously tried to gather all of the data!Hmm\u2026 perhaps we should have gathered data secretly and only told people afterwards,it\u2019s quite difficult it is to gather data on every single person who comes up to speak to you, as to both input data and have a meaningful conversation at the same time is pretty tricky\u2026especially if many people are introducing themselves to you at once, and especially, especially if you are also drinking at the same time. Giorgia and I looked at each other with a panicked look in our eyes: how would we ever manage this week of data-tracking? The first evening of the week we had to quickly lay down some ground rules, of which the main one was after four drinks, we could stop tracking and just enjoy the evening. I ended up jettisoning some of my complex data-gathering because it was just too difficult to gather so much data during each introduction to another person. By day two we noticed that our behaviour was changing, and sometimes we would run through crowds quickly so we wouldn\u2019t have to gather any more data about anyone else. But of course, while it was a challenging week of data-gathering, I\u2019m pleased that we asked people to come and say hello, and here\u2019s why: to be honest, I have never been the type of person who would walk up to someone they didn\u2019t know at an event; I\u2019m pretty shy and lack the confidence to do this. It seem strange but I would rather speak in front of a crowd of people as opposed to approach someone individually, and this is why I like public speaking: it means that after you give your talk, people will approach you so you don\u2019t have to muster up the courage to approach them. Clever, right? So thanks for saying hi, Eyeo: I\u2019m happy you did, as it made my week in Minneapolis such a great one. And who else made this a great week? Giorgia! It was nice to spend time together in person, seeing in real life the different aspects of her personality that she outlined in her postcards over so many weeks...there are many similarities between us, and I was so sad to leave Minneapolis and was already planning my next trip to visit in New York.Now, I didn\u2019t only track new people I met but also wanted to track reunions as well, mainly because I travelled to Indiana to visit my family directly after the festival. I wanted to have a record of seeing my mom for the first time in ages (hi Mom! I know you\u2019ll read this), and hugging my grandma, my aunts, my uncles, my cousin after a year. Oh, dear: I think this might be another one of those datasets that makes me a little emotional every time I think of it, but I think data derived from aspects of the collective human experience tend to do that. I drew this card as best I could to do justice to all of the lovely people who helped us gather data through coming to speak to us, drawing and re-drawing until I thought it was perfect.

I analyzed only the playlists I created, and not the ones that are shared with somebody else or the ones I follow; to communicate to Stefanie only the songs I actively decided to add.Every song in the postcard is represented by a black tiny elements, songs are grouped accordingly to my playlists and colored according to their genre.To define the genre, I looked for my songs on Spotify\u2019s genres lists. Apparently my music is all categorized under: electronic / industrial / electro jazz / jazz / swing / folk / baroque pop (which I didn\u2019t even know being a genre) / indie rock / classic / ambient / minimal techno / punk and metal: \u2026I deduce I am pretty coherent with my music, if you think that Spotify lists 944 genres!I also added attributes to each song indicating whether it has an \u201cemotional meaning\u201d, or it evokes a precise memory, and if I used to listen to it also before the year 2000.

I listened to my music all the times, hanging around with my friends who also dedicated unreasonable amount of time to discover new bands, to explore new music to be the cool one to find the most alternative artists.I believe music for us was also the first step that felt like independence: you would buy your first CDs with your allowance, and - if you lived in a small town like I used to - you would take the bus to a bigger city close by to get to a decent CD store; which actually was the highlight of our Saturday afternoons, at the time.The songs we would listen to are now a source of nice memories, they remind me of my adolescence, they still resonate with me in a way that newer ones I like are not able to.\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""But thanks, Spotify."", ""content"": "" But I also have a good number of much more contemporary stuff in my lists, don\u2019t worry.\u00a0And I should thank Spotify for that: as for many other people, I guess, it\u2019s my current source of discovery.With my boyfriend and my friends we don\u2019t use to talk about the music we listen to, we don\u2019t read about music anymore and we honestly don\u2019t hang out to concerts of new bands that often.

I tried to categorise this music in a way that would tell Giorgia the most about my musical preferences, first organising my music by how old it was. I did this to highlight how I very rarely listen to older music, but prefer to listen to tracks that are only a year or two old\u2026 I don\u2019t mind music that\u2019s a little older but to me, listening to anything from the past feels as though I am falling behind and slipping away from the present: I have lots of \u2018muso\u2019 friends so I try to keep up with them by searching out new sounds. However, recently I started re-listening to a few tracks from FOUR years ago and I feel like a bit embarrassed when I do this, as though I am wallowing in nostalgia or something. I am always wary of living in the past, as new music has a vibrancy and a feeling of freshness that fades as a song becomes part of our cultural fabric, so I guess I\u2019m always hunting for this excitement. Next, I also gathered data on whether or not the song had vocals, and if it did, whether it was an MC or not. My interest in music with MCs is mainly due to my history: when I was young I grew up listening to drum\u2019n\u2019bass from the UK, sitting in Denver (but dreaming of London) and listening to the MCs do their thing over these tracks. Then, when I finally moved to London, the music streaming out of houses or cars or pirate radio stations made me interested in grime, bashment, or any beat-driven dance music from London that is tinged with that particular dark and moody London sound. I moved to this city for the music and it hasn\u2019t disappointed me, the producers and music-makers from my city make me proud to live here.Finally, I highlighted songs that were remixes, again to show Giorgia the type of music I listen to: I mainly listen to dance music, or beat-driven music that is in a state of flux, able to be chopped-up, remixed, and re-worked into new forms every week and merged and mashed with other tracks by a dj, where they become part of a bigger hour-long experience. I think when you are young you choose guitars or you choose beats, and I chose beats. I generally dislike guitar-driven music, and have barely any \u2018guitar music\u2019 \u00a0in my collection.Ah, as a mid-30s married woman living a domestic life in a house on the edge of \u2018proper\u2019 London I think I would get an eyeroll from the youthful concertgoers if I ever went out to some of this music live but I\u2019m content just to listen at home or through my headphones as I walk about the city. Hey, you on-point, cutting-edge, 18-year-olds, have another dance (or whatever you call it these days) for me.When I received Giorgia\u2019s card I liked seeing how we approached the visual in a similar fashion: I like how these synchronicities happen without us realising it. And Giorgia listens to more music from her past, from her \u2018old\u2019 versions of herself, whereas I don\u2019t, and this probably says something about the two of us. Like I mentioned before, I only focus on the present in music, because listening to older music reminds me of who I once was, and sometimes my past selves were embarrassing or cringeworthy. Music instantly transports you back to these past selves, so I think that Giorgia must be more accepting of her past than I am because she still keeps it as part of her life instead of trying to erase it as I do.""}]"

However, since laughing comes so naturally, it\u2019s quite difficult to track. It took a day of acclimation to get used to tracking laughs, so I only felt as though I was actually capturing my laughter properly by Tuesday.I enjoyed tracking laughter as it meant that I lived for a little longer in my laughter than usual, which brightened my mood. Istarted to listen more closely to how soft or how loud my laughter is, noticing I laugh in different ways depending on the situation. However, I found it difficult having to pause and record my laughs in a circle of good friends as it often meant that I couldn\u2019t share in the moment properly with them. While for most of the time I enjoy the data-gathering Giorgia and I use to learn more about ourselves and each other, I can also see that for certain types of data it can detract from the experience. There\u2019s a happy medium to be found, I guess.And since the beginning of our project, this is the first time that I had to resort to analogue data collection, writing down my laugh data on a scrap of paper during a pub quiz so people wouldn\u2019t think I was cheating when I was entering my data into my phone. (my team got second, thought that might be important to mention here)However, because this was my birthday week I had some parties and nice dinners, and this inevitably meant that I would have some data voids: at my party, I stopped tracking laughter as the night went on due to the fact that tracking often intruded upon the good time that I had with my friends. Then, when my husband took me to quite a nice restaurant for my birthday dinner I was banned from tracking laughter, which was fair enough really (and a relief: having a couple hours of rest from tracking data might have been one of my favourite birthday presents).I also received a present of some lovely new drawing pens in the post from Giorgia this week! Both Giorgia and some of my other good friends have been so great for my birthday, their kindness made it one of the best I\u2019ve had for awhile.\u00a0I was worried about how weird my drawing was this week, as evidenced by my comments on the card. However, over time I\u2019ve changed my mind and I quite like it, even if it looks a little crazy. I come to realise I prefer drawing in a way where I feel less-restrained and rigid.However, upon receiving Giorgia\u2019s postcard I knew she had \u2018won\u2019 our week of laughter: I loved her drawing so much, as to me it looks like some happy, pretty laughter would sound. I have been laughing (oh, I\u2019d better track that) at how our drawing approach has diverged over the weeks: mine is more loose and messy, and hers is more defined and detailed.\u00a0""}]"

From one hand I absolutely am a routine person: I like to have my days precisely planned, I find myself happy when I am in control of what\u2019s happening, I have my schedule and I stick to it always. I don\u2019t normally even like to try new foods. I always say that my routine supports my discipline, helps me to stay committed to what I do, and to do it well. But from the other hand I am incredibly eager to try new things: precisely, only the kind of things I actively choose to embrace. I love to grow, to take in bigger challenges, to be creatively inspired by new worlds.I am not sure if I make any sense to anybody other than me here, but my sense of what\u2019s going on is my habits and strict routine help me being free for and open to bigger changes, the ones that I need to grow.\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""Tiny achievements"", ""content"": "" Of course what I\u2019ve just touched upon describes me as a human being, in the general sense and in the long term.

Or, maybe I still am, but needing to gather data on this activity made it less spontaneous?Trying to incorporate \u2018newness\u2019 into a daily routine is difficult sometimes: I could push work aside and sit in the park, or start drinking alcohol at 8am, and yes, that would be new but not necessarily an improvement on my life. So, in the end, my moments of trying new things were really quite small, and were mainly ways for me to break my routine. I don't think I really like the performative weeks; while I start them with the best of intentions (I do, Giorgia, I always do!) by the end of the week they make me grumble and feel like a petulant teenager.Or maybe this just wasn\u2019t the best week in general, as I\u2019ve been starting to feel the effects of a year-long project: I seem to have a sort of drawing paralysis, where I find it incredibly difficult to pick up a pen or pencil and draw my card. The consequence of this paralysis means that I mail my postcards later and later each week all the while fretting about this and forcing myself to make the first mark on paper.We are at week 43 (!) and sometimes it feels this sort of project can take a mental toll, and when I am very busy it often feels as though Dear Data is wrapping itself around my life, through my thoughts, and infiltrating into every interaction with everyone around me. I\u2019ve often discussed this idea of how data-gathering can become an endurance test, a feat of physical and mental pain one puts oneself through in order to get to a higher level of achievement. So, I guess that this 'pain' that I'm going though is a good thing, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it. Anyhow, I gathered my paltry \u2018new\u2019 data from this week and thought that I would also try something (sort of) new on my postcard to hopefully deflect from how boring and cautious I was. So, I decided to work with new pens and explore a different method of drawing and collage than I\u2019ve done before. This postcard was laborious to create, but by the end I felt proud of the results and popped the card in the post to Giorgia. But of course, the postal service only ruins the cards you care most about and my postcard arrived at Giorgia's completely mangled and torn.The glue I used in my collage wasn't strong enough and some of the paper strips were ripped off the card...apparently some of my data fell off and is likely lying somewhere in a postal depot. I was so distraught that I quickly got in touch with Giorgia, asking if I could resend the card since some of the data was missing. Giorgia approved, so I sent another postcard, using a stronger glue than before, and luckily the card survived with all of its data intact.I like Giorgia\u2019s drawing this week, she has a skill of using barely any pen lines to communicate such a rich amount of information. I think she had more fun than me this week, particularly when she was trying on fancy dresses, but I like how her lines \u2018trembled\u2019: it\u2019s funny how I feel afraid and alone on the performative weeks, but when I finally receive Giorgia\u2019s card I realise we both felt the same way!""}]"

To me, there is nothing more frustrating than those days where every time I start to focus, something else pops up to interrupt me, and most of the times I am not really able to \u2018say no\u2019 to those diversions.In a world where we are online on multiple devices and communication channels simultaneously, it\u2019s easy to feel like we have to be available at all times, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to prioritize your tasks and to be truly faithful to your plan.This week has been a helpful exercise not only to remind me that there is nothing that can\u2019t wait a couple of hours, but also to identify my \u201cnot to do\u201d list: an inventory of things I will stop doing so I can concentrate on what really matters.\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""My data"", ""content"": "" I tracked all the times when a \u201cdistraction\u201d actually made me abandon or delay the primary activity I was focused on.

So I collected: - what was I doing? - what distracted me? - And for how long did I stop my main activity?Turns out the most of the interferences happens of course while I work (on my defense, it makes sense because I spend most of my time working :D), but I get fairly distracted also when I listen to podcasts while walking, or while getting dressed/prepared for the day, and sometimes even while I am engaging in conversations with my boyfriend while having dinner :( (sorry!)The most of the distractions come of course from notifications on my Iphone, and it\u2019s not very surprising; but still it was only by acknowledging each one of them for an entire week that I realized vividly I needed to do something about it! In fact, I think there's nothing better than deeply understanding how you're spending your time in the present to make any changes on it in the future!Anyway - the treat of the week was getting pinged while dancing at a party with my friend - which I considered my main activity of course - by a guy who said to me: \u201cI just wanted to tell you how much I loved your Dear Data talk at Eyeo\u201d :) fun Dear-Data recursion!\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""Diversion Drops"", ""content"": "" From the beginning I envisioned my card as a sequence of tiny symbols indicating the three main data sources through their shapes and colors.\u00a0It was immediately clear to me that each symbol should be composed by two halves: the left part indicating my main activity, and the right part representing the interference, and then the indication of how long I stopped doing what I was doing should be determined by the length of the symbol.\u00a0And drops seemed a nice metaphor!""}, {""header"": ""Diversion Trees"", ""content"": "" HA!

Personally, I am in various ways exploring the characteristics and the many aspects of human relationships, I am very interested in human behaviors, personal self and psychology related topics most of all. I am fascinated by everything around the relationships between people, I love getting deep into life situations, and finding analogies and differences in the way we, as human beings, think, behave and take decisions.Professionally, I am very intrigued by the search for vey customized visual models to represent data: new visuals able to represent the peculiarities of every dataset, and Dear Data is the perfect combination of these two aspects!\u00a0""}]"

My days are spent in combat between my ambitious, organised self and my distracted self. I have to set up different tactics in order to get work done: sitting in caf\u00e9s working with only my phone so it\u2019s harder to use the internet, setting timers for a half-hour and forcing myself to focus for this time period: in short, every productivity trick in the book has made an appearance in my working practice. Yet still, I find it difficult to focus: I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve veered off track about 10 times while writing these words, and I haven\u2019t quite been able to tackle this messy side of my personality. Upon reflection, I think during this week of data-gathering we didn\u2019t properly touch upon the elephant in the room: that our yearly data-gathering is a distraction from doing something just like any other. Sometimes it\u2019s a useful distraction, and sometimes it functions less as a distraction and more as a reminder to be aware, but it\u2019s still an additional layer over our lives that can affect how engaged we are in the act of living. I enjoy this data-gathering distraction, but equally, as I\u2019ve mentioned in previous weeks, I think that some data-gathering makes the distraction more worthwhile than others. Other philosophical musings on distraction (hey, this is what happens as I walk around my city pondering my data-gathering each week: I try to more closely define what these terms actually mean): distraction is only a bad thing when it prevents you from completing a task. A distraction when you are out drinking with friends or lounging about your house on a Saturday aren\u2019t distractions, but just\u2026 pottering, I guess. Letting distractions take you where they will is a sign of freedom, so distractions on the weekend aren\u2019t really the same as a distraction during the workweek.Looking back over the data I\u2019ve collected this week, of course I was distracted from work the most, and mostly through social media or news websites\u2026 no surprise here. Regardless, I need to remember that if I better manage my distractions during working I will have more time for the \u2018good\u2019 distractions at the weekend or in the evening, where I can potter and be distracted in that luxurious, enjoyable way that you can be when you feel like you\u2019ve completed all the tasks you need to. Normally I am very late drawing my postcard because being late is my signature style, but I\u2019m proud of this card: I drew it quickly and posted it early, and I like the results for such a simple, quick postcard: all of the lines were drawn as though they were veering off-track, alluding to how I feel whenever I am distracted. Looking at Giorgia\u2019s card you can tell that text messages are what distract her the most\u2026 but it makes sense as I don\u2019t think I tracked text message distractions so closely as they happen so often they almost feel as though they are inevitable. Looking at Giorgia\u2019s card has reminded me that the low-level distraction of text messages all add up and make a huge impact in how focused I am during the day. I need to turn off my phone more often!""}]"

However, I never realised how my apologies take many different forms, from my \u2018perfectionist\u2019 apologies, to the types of apologies I write when replying to another email in a less-than-timely manner, to apologising whenever I bump into someone on the street (the British version of saying \u2018excuse me\u2019, or \u2018pardon me\u2019).Unfortunately, the data from this week that gave me the most pause were the times when I apologised because I was mad at myself and mad at my mistakes as opposed to the situation actually requiring an apology. This is a shame, as it just makes me feel bad about myself unnecessarily\u2026 by apologising repeatedly, even when I am not in the wrong, I am always on the back foot in a situation.\u00a0Also, I am so embarrassed to realise that I often apologised for \u2018being annoying\u2019. This is a terrible habit: sometimes I apologise because I feel as though I am bothering other people, that I am an imposter, that I don\u2019t belong somewhere. This is a constant feeling, and when I get nervous or have a terrible bout of impostor syndrome I start to apologise for the most inconsequential things.\u00a0Oh, perhaps this week should have been a performative data-gathering week, where we gathered data on all of the times we wanted to apologise, but we instead held our tongue\u2026by the end of this project I\u2019m going to have a list of habits that I would like to change in myself: maybe the perfect material for another year-long project?\u00a0Giorgia\u2019s card arrived in the post and as usual, she always records data on herself (her apologies) AND on other people (others apologies to her). I never seem to remember to do this in my data-gathering, so I\u2019m feeling pretty self-centred at the moment!\u00a0However, thinking about this has given me an epiphany: repeatedly apologising for everything is pretty self-centred as well, in a way. A person who keeps apologising for everything must think that anything they do wrong will shake up the entire world when in reality, the world will keep spinning quite nicely with or without their mistakes, so why make such a big deal about them?""}]"

If we think about it, sharing our bookshelf is sharing a part of ourself: our travels, the things we\u2019re more interested in, our aspirations, our pasts... Still, my current bookshelf is unfortunately a small selection of the books I\u2019ve owned in my life, since I shipped only the volumes I truly wanted to have with me from Italy and lately I haven\u2019t bought many new ones, since I use to read fiction on my kindle.Generally speaking, as much as I would love having all of my books in my apartment,\u00a0a moving oversea and several subsequent movings in different apartments (and walk ups!) in New York taught me to truly appreciate living with less, a lot less.\u00a0In my postcard, each element is a book I have in my apartment, ordered according to their location in my bookshelf at the moment of my survey. As I anticipated, the great majority (up to the 80%) of my books are back in my hometown, and we keep the publications that feature our work in our office in Manhattan. I feel this book survey doesn\u2019t really reflect my belongings, but rather talks about what I like to have with me, what is the selection of the publications I owned that still speaks to me these days.Visually, elements\u2019 thickness and height represents books real size, their color its the main genre, featuring drawing, illustration, art, catalogues of exhibitions, architecture-urbanism, design, data visualization, music notation, English grammar, other strange-experimental artsy volumes, publications about New York, non-fiction and only one novel (the red element) which belongs to my boyfriend.\u00a0As opposed to how I organize my closet,\u00a0I don\u2019t arrange my books according to their colors, given that my \u2018bookshelf' is actually the internal windowsill of our living room, I just lay them down in order to make them stand up, trying to avoid a domino chain.By surveying my bookshelfI came up with different attributes to classify them and to add little symbols to my drawings: - books I didn\u2019t finish, ones I haven\u2019t read, and ones I had no idea I owned! - books I really like and have an emotional relationship with, - books that are filled with post-its and notes, - Italian volumes, - gifts, and publications that belongs to boyfriend, - books I know the authors of,\u00a0 - and ultimately, books that have been shipped from Italy, and their level of damage.In fact,\u00a0this week reminded me very vividly the painful process of selection of \""what to ship and what to leave\"" while emptying our apartment in Milan (and I have to thank my boyfriend for censoring me very hard).This week also recalled the funny (but also painful!) waiting time as we held on until our books arrived in New York: the 6 boxes we shipped at the same time arrived one after the other in a random way, more and more damaged as days passed. The last box got to us practically destructed, as if somebody had been kicking it step by step from Italy to here, and our poor books inside it weren\u2019t really in a good shape!This survey also offered me the chance to flip through my most beloved book of all times: \u201cLotta\u2019s bike\u201d - which is actually the only modern version I found of \u201cBritta in Bicicletta\u201d, an illustrated children book I used to read (well, look at) practically every day in the public library of my little town when I was a child.How many memories around the story and from each single illustration, I am thankful to this week for this nice commemoration!As for each of the surveys we made so far, I now am very curious to see Stefanie\u2019s actual bookshelf. There is something magic in describing your belongings through a selection of their attributes, for who reads it, it is a open door for raising questions!\u00a0""}]"
46,Week 46: A week of books we own,Stefanie,46_Stefanie_DearData_46+front.jpg,46_Stefanie_DearData_46+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""It was lucky this was the week that we chose to survey our books for each other, as it was the first time in two years that I've actually been able to access my bookshelf: normally it's dusty and inaccessible due to being surrounded by towers of two-year-old moving boxes (the usual story). Planning to have the room painted while on holiday meant that after some last-minute shifting of all the furniture around the house in preparation, my bookshelf ended up front and centre in my living room, having been dusted with all books organised by theme: ideal for some data-gathering. The bookshelf is one of those annoying Ikea Expedit sets of shelves that are perfect for records but completely unsuitable for books, and every time I look at it, I give it a special glare\u2026 I hate this bookshelf. However, I\u2019m willing to look at it this week for the task at hand and am always surprised at how few books I actually have, which is no small feat considering I used to work as a book designer. When I was young I would daydream having a massive library with shelves and shelves of books... but then I moved to London, the land of tiny box rooms, and my dreams were scuppered. Still, many of my books are hidden away, though I would really call them my portfolio more than anything: I still save copies of the books and book covers that I designed, or books and publications that my work was featured in, just in case I ever have my own design retrospective (ha, yes, a very self-centred response, though a woman can dream, right? at least I can pore over these old designs when I am old and grey)I enjoyed using this week of data-gathering to reacquaint myself with my book collection. So many of my books hold a special significance for me from different times of my life. For example, you can see evidence of past careers on this shelf, particularly because I still have so many books that I got for free when i worked in publishing (lofty classics that I keep meaning to read but never get around to). I\u2019ve also saved so many books because I\u2019ve judged them by their beautifully-designed covers instead of holding onto them for their intellectual depths. And then there are the aspirational books: books that promise to make me more productive, or organised, or a better cook, or help me to learn how to code (still getting there, guys), generally read once and then left to gather dust. I also still save books that I particularly love or were important to me in various stages of my life, including novels by Jack Kerouac and Irvine Welsh (from my teenage years), Jane Austen (guilty pleasure but I don\u2019t care), and one of my favourite classics I continually re-read: Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray.As I gathered data on these books, I came across the battered paperback that I first read when I was 12 or 13, reading and re-reading it so much that I used to be able to recall where certain plot elements were by where they were positioned on the page: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith. This is my favourite book, and I still re-read this book whenever I would like the comfort of a well-known narrative. The story takes place in the early 20th century in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where Giorgia lives now: a nice coincidence for this postcard project!Giorgia\u2019s perfectly-measured drawing is another reminder of her architectural roots, though it\u2019s also pretty evident in the type of books she has in her house as well. My favourite part of the postcard is how you definitely know that this is a \u2018working\u2019 bookshelf as opposed to mine (which is more of a time capsule, really): she has post-it notes in so many of her books for reference! I like how such a tiny data point can create such a vivid image in my mind of Giorgia flipping through books at home...""}]"
47,Week 47: A week of smells/scents,Giorgia,47_Giorgia_DearData_47_Front.jpg,47_Giorgia_DearData_47_Back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""Stefanie and I have been discussing the topic of this week for a little: as much as we both were fascinated to capturing and cataloguing the scents of our cities, we were also afraid to realize we have a poor sense of smell.Mostly, I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cgrasp\"" the odors, I worried they would disappear to my senses before I could even decode them in my mind.It turned out I was right. In a whole week I could only clearly detect 160 smells, roughly 23 per day, it\u2019s a very small number!in my postcard each blurred symbol represent a smell I vividly sensed during my week, in chronologic order. I liked the idea of depicting \u201cthe smell\u201d as a sort of brush stroke that fades away, conveying the feeling of an intense breath that dies out.The colors of each symbol indicates the general category I classified the scents within, and the other visual attributes help recognizing how long did it last, its intensity and my reactions to it: was a pleasant smell? Did it remind me something specific? Could I label it or \u00a0would it fall into \u201cthere oughta be a german word for that?\""There are so many smells that are tight specifically to New York, in my mind.\u00a0 This city and its different neighborhoods have very intense and peculiar odors, like I\u2019ve never really sensed before moving here. And seasons have their peculiar smells too here. As the hot summer get going you can literally be assaulted by smells as you walk the streets:\u00a0burnt pretzels and spicy curry from street vendors in Midtown,\u00a0early morning fish water in Chinatown, the characteristic smell of the many 99cents pizza shops all around, the familiar clean fresh laundry scent coming up from the basements of residential areas, coconut shampoo and sunscreen fragrances from people in the streets\u2026and also the less pleasant acute odors of garbage, sweat and smoke.But honestly, I somehow like even odors normally considered unpleasant here in New York, they are a vital, subtle but always present reminder of where I live now, and of how this city is different from where I am from.I was born and raised in a very small town in Italy, and I\u2019ve been exposed to a set of different odors of my surroundings growing up.\u00a0However there are smells here that can carry me back to my childhood, and I love when it happens.\u00a0Smell is a memory tool they say,\u00a0Diane Ackerman in A Natural History of the Senses writes: \""Smells detonate softly in our memory like poignant land mines,\u00a0hidden under the weedy mass of years and experiences.\u00a0Hit a tripwire of smell,\u00a0and memories explode all at once.\""We all know how this is true, and how pleasant is this fleeing moment when a smell gets us back in time: \u201cwhat is it?\u201d we would ask and survey our minds about. I wish it It\u2019d happen more often!I am realizing more and more how much I like reading Stefanie\u2019s postcards when the topic deals with her surroundings, when the postcard helps me picturing her days.I loved imagining her time in London at week 32, when we logged the sounds of our surroundings; and I enjoyed flipping her card back and forth this week trying to visualize where she\u2019s been by the means of the smells she could detect.I believe data that grasps routinely and ordinary moments such as these ones are neat entry points to our lives, they are the backgrounds of our habits and journeys through our days.""}]"
47,Week 47: A week of smells/scents,Stefanie,47_Stefanie_DearData_47+front.jpg,47_Stefanie_DearData_47+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""A confession: I can't stand the word 'smell'. Not only does the actual sound and pronunciation of the word leave a funny feeling in my mouth, it also seems as though it refers to something that smells faintly disgusting.So, I'll try to use the word 'scent' instead, like a posh perfumer, as I can only imagine how difficult it would be to market themselves as 'purveyors of fine smells.' But still, 'scent' doesn't appeal to me either. I am someone who has powerful feelings of repulsion to the words she hates, so perhaps it's just me, but in the English language I don't think we've cracked upon the right word for something that can be so evocative, so easily able to inspire powerful feelings in ourselves, and so attached to emotions and memories.As we tracked the 'scents' we gathered this week I only gathered data on the scents that I noticed as I went about my day. I originally tried to gather scents from the top of every hour but scents are different than sounds in that while they are continuous, you only really notice them when they change, and then you often get used to them and then they disappear as quickly as they came.I chose to organise the scents of my week by location, many of which are along my walking route to and from my Brixton studio. I've included myself and my husband as moving locations as well, as there are so many scents that are often found on our persons, but not the surrounding environment. Even just by seeing the locations I travel near or through without even looking at the scent data, Giorgia can get a good idea of my week.It was interesting to realise that most of the scents I smell are synthetic as opposed to natural. Of course, I was smelling lots of freshly painted walls in my house, but this was due to having our upstairs painted while we went away on holiday, so even for a week or so after the scent/smell lingered.However, what is more everyday is the scent of all the perfume, shower gel, laundry detergent, shampoo, and so on that I put on my body or use to wash my clothing. I didn\u2019t realise how many synthetic perfumes I use (and I\u2019ll admit that I quite like them), but I never took myself to be someone who needed to surround themselves in synthetic scents. I always watch adverts on telly for a \u2018new\u2019 amazing air freshener with bemusement, as I\u2019ve never felt the need to fill my living environment completely with synthetic perfume, but I suppose that is exactly what I am doing by wearing all the perfumes and using all of the scented products that I choose to use.But what can I say? I don\u2019t like the smell of body odor, as evidenced by the fact that it is one of my least favourite smells noted on my card (I absolutely hate the smell of a hot, packed tube train). I guess I wear so so many scented products because I fear smelling like a scent I really dislike.My favoured scents are not very out-of-the-ordinary: rain, woodfire, the smell of my laundry detergent.But my most favourite scents come as no surprise, I\u2019m sure: my husband (in general) and my husband when he steps out of the shower. I know, weird, but not exactly unusual, and I\u2019m sure there is some super-scientific pheromonal excuse for this. It\u2019s funny how the scent of my husband can be one of my favourite whereas the scent of a stranger is one of my least favourite: context when it comes to scents (particularly those associated with humans) is obviously critical.Finally, what I like best about the moments I captured my husband\u2019s scent is that this data also becomes a record of when I was close to him: I could have only captured these scents after giving him a hug, or lying close to him, or being very near. I like how by gathering one dataset you can then reveal another.We are at Week 47 and I am still unable to fully grasp how Giorgia can gather the data that she gathered: how can she capture the duration of a scent while also getting her work done and going about her day? Perhaps she has some special super-human power that I just don\u2019t have, as I have always found the data-capturing to be a challenge.Regardless, it\u2019s interesting that we both smell relatively the same scents: our partners, our perfumed toiletries and the perfumes of others. Until we embarked on this exercise I would have thought that the scents of our week would be more diverse than they really are!""}]"
48,Week 48: A week of eavesdropping,Giorgia,48_Giorgia_DearData_48_Front.jpg,48_Giorgia_DearData_48_Back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""This week we wanted to observe (re: spy) the strangers around us, specifically, documenting what they were talking about.\u00a0So we spent the entire week trying to overhear conversations we caught glimpses of to understand and report the main topics.\u00a0I think I suggested this week\u2019s topic in the first place, I imagined it would be fun, but I found it hard and draining in the end!I have different ways to collect my data, and this depends on how clear it is to me what\u2019s interesting to gather at the beginning of the week.\u00a0For example, when the topic is still pretty vague on Monday mornings, I would just jot down lots of notes about every entry point, and refine my reports during the week when I figure out what to \u201cask\u201d to my data.Some other times - like this one - when I already know what I want to discover, I set up specific questions to gather my data, and use the Reporter App\u00a0as an aid to my collection.My queries for my week of playing secret agent were: - who are the victims? (are they two men, two women, a couple, a group, a man or woman talking over the phone?) - what is the situation (are they chatting in a cafe, walking the street, shopping at a store and so on) - what language do they speak? (we both live in a multicultural city, and it\u2019s nice to notice the many languages of the people we encounter) - how long could I spy them for? - and, most importantly: what are they talking about?It turns out I didn\u2019t make any revolutionary discover. My overheard conversations span from gossiping, complaining, organizing or making plans, sharing family issues or work related matters, sometimes fighting about trivial stuff, mentioning New York and specific areas of it, and referring to people or situations other than the talkers.Many times I could only hear bits of a dialogue without getting the main \u00a0subject because the environment was too noisy or because I wasn\u2019t close enough. Many times people around me were speaking a foreign language I couldn\u2019t understand, but at least I tried to detect what it was. Many other times I started to listen but - honestly - I got incredibly bored.The nicest note of the week was catching to two Italian women clearly commenting about me and my outfit: as many times happens when you speak a foreign language, they were sure I couldn\u2019t understand them! In my postcard, I tried to convey the main idea for the week by shaping each conversation I\u2019ve heard as a \u201cear\"", the length of which represents how long I\u2019ve been listening.\u00a0Actually, my initial main query \u201cwhat are they talking about\u201d wasn\u2019t what I turned out to be most compelled by.\u00a0In fact, I\u2019ve been more curious about what the relationship between them was rather than what they were talking about: were they a couple? Was it a first date? Were they working pals or friends? And also, how were they feeling about each other? Was one of the two bored to death because clearly only one of them was speaking, or were they both engaged in the conversation?I think Stefanie and I both agreed this wasn\u2019t a great topic, and generally we were expecting much extraordinaries discoveries to draw and share with each other, sorry Stef I suggested it in the first place!\u00a0""}]"
48,Week 48: A week of eavesdropping,Stefanie,48_Stefanie_DearData_48+front.jpg,48_Stefanie_DearData_48+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""As soon as I left the house I knew data-gathering this week would be a challenge, and I walked from my house to my train platform with a feeling of dread that intensified once I saw a crowd of people and I knew I had to start my spying. Oh, dear, what were we thinking? I don\u2019t actually want to spy on people, I\u2019m just a person who wants to stand on a train platform and stare off into space and daydream, or stare at and tap aimlessly at my phone, or listen to music, and is there anything wrong with that? As with other performative weeks, living in London means I am very conscious of not intruding into the small wedges of private space that Londoners try to carve out for themselves in a crowd of people: this personal, private space is precious and there is an unspoken agreement that everyone lets everyone else be, and respects these boundaries. This is a very London thing, as while in New York I am always uneasy when people speak to me on public transport, because were I in London this would be a sign that this person was potentially a little unusual and possibly volatile.Because of this, (and I know I am repeating myself here, as I do every vaguely performative week), these more performative weeks are hard for me. I try to like them, but they make me angry! I am starting to realise that this is both because of my aforementioned unease with breaking into someone\u2019s private space and also, it means that I can\u2019t have the precious wedge of private time for reflection and solitude that public transport and walking are for me in this city. I feel cheated out of time for myself when I have to interact with others for this project, and this always makes me sulk at the beginning of the week.Slowly, however, my grumpiness disappeared as I settled into a more relaxed way of listening to conversations around me. My biggest insight? Most people are talk about boring subjects, mainly carrying out \u2018administrative\u2019 conversation where they are discussing public transport and planning their movements across London. Also, while I tried to eavesdrop there was one main barrier that prevented me from overhearing conversations many times: many of the conversations that I heard were spoken in other languages, or were spoken in English dialects / patois that were too difficult for me to understand. London is the capital city of a country that once had an empire where the sun never set, on a continent with multiple separate languages in a relatively small area, so of course I am accustomed to hearing a sea of languages and sounds around me as I move about my city. However, these different languages are comforting instead of alien: I like not knowing everything about the people or the place I inhabit, I love living in a city that is continually mysterious and too big to be fully-known. Perhaps this is the reason why I came to live in London in the first place: to never feel as though I know everything, and focusing upon eavesdropping and languages has reminded me of this. I drew this card to look as though little speech bubbles were creeping in from the edges of the paper, as though the postcard was overhearing these conversations. In the end, I\u2019m pleased with this postcard as it has become a nice record of what I love about London, which is this cacophony of different languages around me. Ok, ok: so perhaps this week of data-gathering wasn\u2019t that bad after all. I know that Giorgia\u2019s drawings are supposed to look like ears, but I like how they also look like question marks, in my mind alluding to the unknown and mysterious nature of these scraps of conversation without context! Also, noticing that Giorgia spied on her friends made me smile, and noticing that there were people she overheard that she wanted to punch made me laugh out loud: I felt the same way so many times this week as well! I\u2019m glad we are both in agreement: some people are just totally insufferable, and it shows in how they speak and communicate with others! ""}]"

In what situations? With whom? Can we find any patterns or interesting stories on it?\u00a0I collected all of the time I said and wrote the word \u201cdata\u201d down (and the Italian version of it, which actually has a plural version (s: dato, p:dati), and the times I\u2019ve heard it mentioned by somebody else.\u00a0On the left part of my postcards sit \u201cmy data\u201d and on the right side are the external ones grouped according to the situations, thus clusters of symbols indicate we\u2019ve been mentioning the D-word more than once in a given situation.\u00a0I wanted to explore a bit with this the drawing for this postcard, I didn\u2019t follow any strict rule for the organization of my data-data (ha!) but rather I\u2019ve been guided by my aesthetic feeling to compose an (hopefully) elegant drawing.\u00a0Every symbol represents a single time the D-word has been said, wrote, heard.\u00a0Different types of symbols indicate what kind of data (i.e. what were the number representing?) the conversation engaged on: were we talking about finance, marketing, advertising, personal data, \u201cdear data\u201d (:)) or other? Additional attributes such as colors and rounded circle illustrate who I was talking about data with, and special anecdotes, namely:\u00a0 - hear 2 strangers in my cowering space simultaneously saying the word data from their two different workstations,\u00a0 - spending a evening with our friend who was present in postcard 2 extensively covering personal data collection topics.\u00a0 - trying to explain data visualization to my hairdresser while getting my hair cut, being sure she didn\u2019t really get it (though while I mentioned Dear Data and how everything can be data in your life I could see a light bulb coming up above her head!)At the beginning of the week I was also keeping record of the number of times I read the word data, but on Tuesday I decided it was just crazy (so many!!) and it didn\u2019t really bring any value to our main question for the week.\u00a0I am having a major insight here Stefanie (at week 49!): probably we should have cooked the format for the data collection slightly differently, where the first day of the week would be for data-gathering-explorations around the topic, and the remaining 6 days would be the actual data collection.\u00a0What drives this thought is the difficulty of coming up with compelling questions for your data tracking before really digging into the topic and actually starting to collect.\u00a0I have been trying to work around this obstacle by hoarding a ridiculous amount of details on my Mondays, seeing what I found more appealing, and defining the exact data collection from my Tuesday and on.\u00a0I also realized how the different annotating tools we use (our moleskines, our evernote or note app, or different tracking apps) influences our data gathering:\u00a0setting up specific questions for our data collection at the beginning of the week brings to different kinds of results than jotting down our logs about the topic and finding data on it only afterwards.\u00a0In general, we always say that with Dear Data we\u2019ve been wanting to explore the role that data can have in understanding our personal experiences and in telling stories of our lives from it, and looking at data as ways to raise new questions. Many people associate the \u201cquantifiable\u201d and \u201cquantitative\u201d with precision and objectiveness, and they are drawn to personal-tracking by the idea that this would solve some of their problems, and finding rational answers. We think these kind of investigations aren\u2019t really about finding definitive answers about ourselves, they are more about raising novel and unexpected questions. Moreover, when we think about data in our lives we always associate it with more efficiency, more automation. We here argue we can absolutely use data to become more human, to connect with ourselves and others at a deeper level.This week has been for sure very meta, and I love how Stefanie smartly reminded it in her postcard by counting the total number of time the word data has been mentioned in her postcard\u2019s legend!And well, this is a nice week\u2019s topic to invite you to complement your reading with our recent interview on the Data Stories podcast! :)\u00a0\u00a0""}]"

And we are very aware that this is not exactly normal, but actually incredibly nerdy, and can only imagine what other people would think about us if they overheard our conversations. (Well, I think I do know, as just the other evening, my long-suffering (non-data) designer husband heard a similarly-data-minded friend and I talking about data all evening at a dinner, then at drinks, then on the way walking home, then actively banned us from talking about data for the rest of the evening, which is fair, I think: there\u2019s only so much a person can take, really.) Anyhow, it seemed to be a topic ripe for data-gathering, so this week, the word \u2018data\u2019 was our data (oh, I have a feeling you will be tired of the word \u2018data\u2019 [Argh! I said it AGAIN!] at the end of this post)I chose to keep my data-gathering simple, in that I only gathered data on when I spoke or wrote the word data myself. Even just restricting myself to this very limited dataset was a challenge as this is a word that I say without even thinking so I have a feeling that I mentioned this word often in my workday without realising it. Thankfully (for my husband, at least), it would be reasonable to conclude from this week of data-gathering that I mainly mentioned the word \u2018data\u2019 to my work colleagues, and not very often to my husband, so he\u2019s gotten off lightly this week, at least. And of course, no question, the \u2018data\u2019 topic that I spoke about most this week was Dear Data\u2026 it\u2019s such a part of my life that I talk about this project so, so much, and I\u2019m amazed at how much of my life has been taken over by this project. I have found it both stressful and exciting but regardless, as we near the end of this year, I am starting to feel both proud of what we\u2019ve done and slightly sad that we will soon be finished. This is one of my favourite postcards, probably because I was using some nice pens and pencils that I recently bought and I love their ice-cream colours. I know this design doesn\u2019t really \u2018look\u2019 like data should look, but here I was just using my data on \u2018data\u2019 as an input to output some nice patterns and have fun, though the information is still relatively accessible.However, as is always the way, this card was lost in the post! So infuriating, particularly as this was one of the few postcards from our year that I\u2019ve actually posted to Giorgia early. After waiting for some time, I finally gave up and accepted that the card wouldn\u2019t arrive and re-drew this. Why do my most favourite cards always get lost? Like Giorgia has said earlier this year, I am assuming that it\u2019s because the postman steals them due to them being his/her favourites as well. And as per usual, Giorgia\u2019s card is much more multi-dimensional than mine, and she gathered more complex data on the word \u2018data\u2019. I love that she talks to her hairdresser about data, which is exciting: that maybe through this project focusing on more domestic, mundane data, we might be able to make data more accessible to a wider audience. Also, I see that she talks about Dear Data as much as I do, and it makes me feel better to know I\u2019m not the only one annoying my friends and partner!Total number of times I mentioned data in this post: 26 (oh, dear)\u00a0""}]"

Because of that I periodically need to downgrade some of them to the second screen (sorry!) when I download a new compelling one. - the last row of my main screen is the most important for me, because it\u2019s close to the dock and very easy to reach with my thumb. At the moment of the survey, the apps sitting there were Evernote, Notes and WhatsApp. - I periodically re-arrange my apps with no real need: just because I like to think I am removing visual clutter and making better organizational choices. - I only have two screens of apps, and on the second screen I relegate those I can\u2019t cancel but don\u2019t use (lots of default Apple apps that are impossible to remove) and those I am still not ready to delete. - (and yes I am a bit neurotic for this all :-))For the survey, I\u2019ve made an estimate of how often I use them, I added details if the app was designed by a friend, if I used it for my data tracking during the year and if the app has been deleted in the past but I dowloaded back (indicating my uncertain relation with it!)""}, {""header"": ""Let\u2019s not talk about my data drawing"", ""content"": "" I have to say, I HATE THIS POSTCARD OF MINE.

Also, photos of my process are on the phone as well (though it might not seem like it, as I never seem to take any, haha). So, while I do have some backups in place, I haven\u2019t been very thorough at backing-up as of late, so every time I leave the house I\u2019m playing a risky game with my Dear Data data.\u00a0This story begins on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon. My husband and I are going to meet friends at a graffiti competition/exhibition, and since the weather is so fine, we decide that cycling to the location (some dark, graffiti-filled tunnels near Waterloo Station) would be a nice way to travel.We pack backpacks and cycle panniers, and prepare for the sunshine by putting on sunblock. My husband takes two clear, liquid sunblock sprays and decides to consolidate them into one bottle. I take this bottle, put on a bit of sunblock, then throw it into my backpack, throw my phone into my backpack, hop on my bike, and off we go.\u00a0It\u2019s a warm day, but a lovely ride, and I\u2019m excited to meet up with friends, have a pint, and wander through these graffiti tunnels. However, when we arrive at our destination and I got off my bike, I noticed that my back was wet.\u00a0Pulling off my backpack, I realise that sunblock has leaked through everything in my bag and all down my back, and pulling out the sunblock, I realised my husband didn\u2019t put the spray nozzle on tight enough and it had worked itself loose, and then pulling out my phone, I realised that it was completely saturated with sunblock, with its screen turning a funny colours and going into a complete meltdown.\u00a0Right when this happened, I went into a complete meltdown as well.\u00a0I threw the sunblock spray onto the ground, yelled at my husband, blaming him for this leak, ran to the pub, tried to clean off all of the sunblock that had soaked through all of my things, trying to figure out if the phone would survive, but slowly realising that the phone\u2019s innards could never survive after being doused in greasy, coconut-scented chemicals.It was about this point that I realised that I might have completely lost much of my Dear Data photos and data, and my meltdown reached a new level.\u00a0I am ashamed to say that I had a very angry, crying, embarrassingly-public shout at my husband due to how distraught I was, both because I was worried I might have lost quite a bit of Dear Data work, that I had let Giorgia down for losing such a critical part of the project, that I would have to pay \u00a3500 for a new phone, and that all of this was happening because of something that was completely out of my control. I hate typing this, as it\u2019s so embarrassing, but yes: for all of this, my husband bore the full brunt of my anger, tears and frustration.Well. We didn\u2019t go to this graffiti competition this day, as I was too worked-up, and too angry. We cycled back home so I could see what content of mine had actually backed up, and during the cycle ride back I tearfully-pedaled behind my husband, burning with frustration, feeling as though the world was against me.\u00a0We got back home, I whipped open my laptop and double-checked my photos, particularly the ones of Dear Data\u2026. all safe. I double-checked a few other things\u2026 all safely backed up. The only thing that I lost of Dear Data was a week of data-gathering (next week), not ideal, but that was it. My anger was lessening, but I still had a \u00a3500 pound block of metal I would need to replace.\u00a0I wrote an emotional email to Giorgia, saying I couldn\u2019t survey my phone properly until I could dry out my phone and see if it could be salvaged (still hoping, even though I knew the truth). I explained the situation, and mentioned how angry I was at my husband. She wrote back, reminding me that it actually wasn\u2019t the end of the world, and telling me \u2018please don\u2019t be too hard on your husband!\u2019\u2026 of course, she was right.\u00a0As my anger lessened, I began to feel incredibly remorseful at how I had reacted to this little loose sunblock cap, which wasn\u2019t left loose out of malice, but was just an accident, and my husband was blamed for it all.\u00a0So started the beginning of many, many apologies to my husband, and lots of nervousness and apologetic, quiet tiptoeing around him, as I knew that I had been completely unreasonable. Thankfully, my husband forgave me, noting that I hadn\u2019t been quite myself earlier in the day (which I wasn\u2019t, I was worrying about work, Dear Data, and all the other things on my to-do list), and that this little incident seemed to be where all the bottled-up worry exploded.I know this is a strange place to find love in a marriage, but this is where it is: love isn\u2019t in over-the-top romantic gestures, but found when I am at my absolute worst and my husband sees me at this worst and forgives me. \u00a0A very public apology to my husband: I\u2019m so sorry for that ridiculous afternoon. Thanks for reminding me to laugh at my irrational grumpiness, and helping me remember that the world isn\u2019t as bad as I sometimes make it!\u00a0(post-script: insurance paid for the phone, and I was able to buy a better phone than I had previously, so in all, this whole escapade ended very well\u2026 oh, I am kicking myself with embarrassment still)Now, onto the postcard: I used a backup of my phone\u2019s applications as my survey data, which is a pretty close representation of what was actually on my phone. (I\u2019ll leave you to look at the card instead of writing more on this long post)Giorgia\u2019s postcard is a beautiful rendering of all the little app icons on her phone, and I see we share many apps (of course). My favourite part of the card are the tiny red dots that highlight that she received a notification within this app while drawing the postcard, which is lovely: a digital moment that is completely ephemeral and often never recorded has now been permanently captured on paper, highlighting one of the main reasons I\u2019ve loved this project through these years: we capture and collect moments that are fleeting for paper posterity.\u00a0""}]"
51,Week 51: a week of privacy,Giorgia,51_Giorgia_DearData_51_Front.jpg,51_Giorgia_DearData_51_Back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""Only two weeks of Dear Data were left at this point, and it has been hard to decide what would be the last two topics to cover within this year-long effort of getting to know each other trough our data. Stefanie had a neat idea or week 51: how about privacy? How about counting and drawing all the things we wouldn\u2019t want the other person (and the whole world) to know? That for sure would reveal a lot about ourselves, even if all our logs would be disguised by our categorizations.I tracked everything that came to mind, and everything I did or reflected upon that for some reasons I wouldn\u2019t like other people to know. Anything spanning from how mean or needlessly grumpy I was with my boyfriend to some deep obsessions of mine as they popped up; from some black thoughts I wanted to bury to shameful habits I realize I have.I wrote down the exact thought or action I would want to keep private when it occurred, and I noted down the \u201clevel\u201d of discomfort I would associate to it going public.I detailed my logs with information only afterwards, categorizing and classifying my private-things at the end of the week before crafting my postcard. There are weeks like this one when you can simply log the exact item (i.e. writing the whole thought or action) and easily come up with groups and sub-labels only later on.My macro categories don\u2019t reveal that much: - work related thoughts, - Dear Data related thoughts (that I will indeed disclose here :)), - friends / family, - my habits, - my behavior with my boyfriend (well this is pretty specific), - and me as a person.But I then added some details to give Stefanie a more precise idea of what I was trying to hide, and per each category I went a little deeper, as you can see from my legend.\u00a0I also incorporated information about \u2018why\u2019 I would want to keep it private: was I ashamed? Did I fear people judgement? Would somebody be hurt if they knew? Did it reveal I am a terrible person? Was I scared of what could have happened?You can see my postcard starts with dashed lines from the left, before displaying my private-logs in chronologic order: this has been my very first massive data void in Dear Data. As a matter of fact, I forgot to track the whole Monday morning\u2026and I am so ashamed to admit it! I know what was going on though: Stefanie and I came from one of those weeks we call \u201csurveys\u201d where we didn\u2019t have to actively track. Plus I had just got back from 12 days of holiday, and that Monday was my first day at work after 2 weeks of vacation, ...I guess I just wasn\u2019t in my routine mode (or was I in subconscious denial for the very topic I needed to track? mmmh!)This was one of those insightful weeks to me.\u00a0One of those when by having to acknowledge specific dark sides and bad behaviors of myself, I realize them incredibly more vividly. Weeks of this kind, when you have to face your worst self, have been the hardest to deal with, but the sort of objectiveness that \u2018counting\u2019 implies gave me the opportunity to overcome the fear of addressing these tricky matters.So many times this week I felt ashamed.I felt ashamed of thinking I am not particularly inspired by my work at the moment, even for small bits of time. I felt guilty I would prefer not to take the time to talk with a friend in need. I felt bad multiple times for how I don\u2019t value enough my relationship to my boyfriend and how easily I snap at him for trivial matters. I felt embarrassed for my need to be in control of the situations I am in: needing to know and decide what time are we doing something, which place are we going to, what is the exact plan for the day, what are we doing next\u2026 Other shameful feelings were triggered by my weird relationship with food and the fact that I don\u2019t really enjoy it, and would rather not spend time dining or tasting (and talking about) particular foods as my friends like doing. Or by how un-necessary splurging I sometimes indulge to. Or by how I am and how I just can\u2019t stop wanting more and, ultimately, being permanently unsatisfied.  Why am I revealing so much? Aren\u2019t I afraid anymore? I think I am not. What Dear Data taught me is that the biggest connections and the best things probably happen when you actually show your vulnerable side, your geeky side, your flaws and bad habits. We tend to share only our best selves to the world - and what we do on Social Media is peculiar to this matter -\u00a0 but the truth is we are human, we are weak, and we all are. And the more honest we can be the better human connections we can reach. (and that's when you get to raise your personal bar too, I guess!)  I love Stefanie\u2019s card, how clever was to physically \u201ccover\u201d her logs with a black mark, on a week where we track privacy! Well, I definitely now would love to know more about her logs!  Oh, and as for Dear Data, well, here are the thoughts I didn\u2019t want to share: - Looking forward to Dear Data being over - Looking forward to not having to track anymore - I would love to some other projects / collaboration with Stefanie after Dear Data, but I am afraid of asking. :) \u00a0""}]"
51,Week 51: a week of privacy,Stefanie,51_Stefanie_DearData_51+front.jpg,51_Stefanie_DearData_51+back.jpg,"[{""header"": """", ""content"": ""This has been a year of relative openness between myself and Giorgia, but we felt we should also focus on the parts of our lives that we would prefer to keep to ourselves. As mentioned last week, I was gathering my private moments as they happened, but due to the Big Phone Meltdown of 2015 I lost this data, so I had to rely on memory to make a list of remembered private moments to draw this week, so this week\u2019s visualisation has become a representation of \u2018private moments that stick in my mind more than any other private moment due to how embarrassing / awful / cringeworthy they are\u2019 (I know you data people out there need a transparent and honest methodology, so that detail is just for you, ha). We are one week away (!) from finishing this project, and over the year I have tried to be relatively honest in presenting my life in \u2018data form\u2019 to Giorgia, but of course, if you were able to peer into the depths of my mind you wouldn't be too surprised at the thoughts lurking within: unpolished, dark and unquestionable thoughts showcasing an uncivilised human at their worst. I guess this dark messy chaos is likely what all of our minds look like inside, and it's only when we edit and package up our thoughts and behaviours in a way befitting our society that we can say we are truly civilised. Civilisation requires an audience, otherwise when left to our own devices you\u2019ll find us in our pants/underwear in the kitchen spooning peanut butter directly from the jar to our mouths... And DOUBLE-DIPPING the spoon (shock / horror). We choose to reveal or hide certain parts of ourselves depending on who this audience is, of course. My husband is one of the only people who has really seen an unedited version of myself (um, again, see last week\u2019s postcard for an example of this), though even then I don\u2019t share everything, as you\u2019ve got to have a little mystery in a marriage, right?) As Giorgia has been the \u2018audience\u2019 for this weekly reveal of myself for the past year, while I definitely have told her things that I don\u2019t just tell anyone, I\u2019ve obscured data points that might be TOO embarrassing, categorising them using careful euphemisms and creating a tailored version of myself. Just another example of how a dataset is never objective, I suppose. Because of this continual shaping of what I reveal weekly to Giorgia, I\u2019ve decided to categorise my data according to how embarrassed I would feel if she found out what these private actions or thoughts were. When looking at the data from my \u2018uncivilised self\u2019 I\u2019ve remembered from this week, I begin to blush at this list of moments or thoughts that I wouldn\u2019t share with others, but equally I revel in how joyfully human, messy, and unpolished they are. Strangely, it\u2019s in this messiness where I see evidence of my humanity and my sense of self the most, and while yes, it makes me cringe, it also makes me happy to be alive. This small, domestic dataset of private moments reminds me of the bigger-picture importance of data privacy. While my interest in data may lie more with finding humanity in the numbers as opposed to creating projects and discourse around the issue of data privacy, I agree we all need a space (either physical or digital) away from an \u2018audience\u2019 to be the messy, chaotic animals we truly are in order to fully understand what it means to be human, and to be ourselves. As Giorgia has often said, we need to remember that these cold data points represent warm, imperfect human beings (who might be sitting in their pants eating peanut butter directly from the jar as I write this).To draw this postcard, I started by gathering honest data, then wilfully obscured this data, and then created a visualisation of this obscured data, which I reinforced visually by drawing black inky circles over the data visualisation as though I was hiding something. I think the sheer perversity of the \u2018visualising in order to obscure\u2019 process makes this one of my favourite postcards of the year. And on to Giorgia\u2019s postcard. I laugh that Week 51 is her first proper DATA VOID, whereas I have had a million! Her most private moments are those where she is grumpy or mean to her boyfriend, and for this I can relate, of course, and we commiserate together about this often, talking about how we get grumpy easily and say not-very-nice things in haste that we often regret later. I like how after a year, I\u2019ve been able to really understand how different Giorgia and I are in many ways (I mean, we disagree on so many design things it\u2019s almost hilarious), but that when it comes to the deeper parts of our personality we are often very similar.

It led to me visualize my plans for my future as I haven\u2019t been able to grasp before.But most of all over a year, I found a friend. Stefanie and I only 2 times before starting Dear Data, and this year-long data correspondence brought us incredibly close, it\u2019s hard to remember that we don\u2019t live in the same city, we\u2019ve been present in each other\u2019s lives as most of our \u201cregular\u201d friends haven\u2019t.Over a year I\u2019ve been able to compose a multifaceted \u2018portrait\u2019 of Stefanie through these 52 fragments of her nature: how she spends her days, what are the positive feelings and negative thoughts that occur to her, what are some aspects of her relationship with her husband, what are her desires and her fears.\u00a0Each postcard has been a starting point to get to know a particular aspect of her, adding pieces to the puzzle, and serving as has the starting point to raise questions, even very personal questions we would ask each other after spending our time deciphering the received data gift.I admit I wasn\u2019t 100% sure we could make it trough a year, but I am so glad we did. We both figured out how the collaborative aspect of the project was crucial for us to be able to stick to it: we\u2019ve been holding each other accountable and pushing each other forward every week. The fact we weren\u2019t \u201cfriends\u201d in the beginning, but rather two people who respected the other for her body of work helped us being committed to the project, we didn\u2019t want to let the other person down, we wanted to impress her.Moreover, by creating an outer expectation (the other person needs to receive the postcards and we agreed upon sticking to it for 52 weeks) we\u2019ve been able to meet an inner expectation: personally - exploring different areas of my personalities and pursue a side and artistic project able to make me grow.It is not been easy at all, we are two strong-minded designers with different design sensibilities, and there has been many design battles along the way while building our website, shaping our public talks, and even recently working on our book.\u00a0But what we have learned from each other has been (and is!) definitely worth it.Also the rigid \u00a0format of the project (weekly data for 52 weeks) helped us staying focused: I realized how easier is it to concentrate on a single little aspect of your life every week - very rigidly - instead of investigating and exploring multiple ones at the same time as I always meant to do in my past (and with no results!).\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""why Dear Data?"", ""content"": "" Personally, I am in various ways exploring the characteristics and the many aspects of human relationships, I am fascinated by everything around relationships between people, and around finding analogies and differences in the way we, as human beings, think, behave and take decisions. \u00a0Professionally, I am very intrigued by the search for new aesthetics in data visualizations: novel engaging visual ways to convey the richness of the stories we experience in our everyday lives, rather than simplifications of the world.Dear data was the perfect excuse to combine and actually spend time doing what I love the most to do: drawing and reflecting upon human nature.Dear Data was always meant to be a personal challenge for us: we have been trying to extend ourselves in both our data collection and our drawing technique: nudging ourselves out of our comfort zones, and exploring and expanding on where one can find data and how it can be represented using new visual systems.""}, {""header"": ""Data, to make us more human"", ""content"": "" Over this year Stefanie and I have been discussing multiple time how experimentations of this kinds, where we drastically limit the tools and the possibilities (like hand drawing with data), help us get back to the real meaning of data. \u00a0Even when we work with \u2018Big Data\u2019 the whole point is making it meaningful, contextual, it\u2019s all about making it smarter, and smaller, understandable.Data is more than numbers, it can represent real life, it can be a snapshot of the world in the same way that a picture catches small moments in time. Data can be emotional, data can link people, and even a relationship between two people can be mediated by data.Many people associate the \u201cquantifiable\u201d and \u201cquantitative\u201d with precision and objectiveness, and they are drawn to personal-tracking by the idea that this would solve some of their problems, and finding rational answers maybe. I think these kind of investigations aren\u2019t really about finding definitive answers about ourselves, they are more about raising novel questions.\u00a0When we think about data in our lives we always associate it with more efficiency, more automation, we argue we can absolutely use data to become more human, to connect with ourselves and others at a deeper level, if we design the right ways to do that.\u00a0_And thank you! I want to take the chance of this last post to thank everyone who supported us on this year-long effort.Thanks to my friends for bearing with my un-polite data trackings that intruded in our conversations and for standing my alternate enthusiasm and despair for the project.  Thanks to our agents Rebecca and Emma at Janklow&Nesbit for guiding our first steps in the world of publishers, and to our editor Helen at Penguin for inspiring us to work on our book in very un-common ways.  Thanks to our dataviz friends, collaborators and Dear Data supporters who made our talks and podcasts interviews possible: Jer, Enrico, Moritz, Jon, Eric, Maral thank you! (and an immense thanks to Nick Felton of course!!)A big thank-you to my boyfriend Gabriele,\u00a0for agreeing to be counted, tracked, mapped and revealed in my postcards, for feeling always joyful about the project, for engaging in Dear-Data conversations almost every day and for having been supportive, positive and never irritated by this year long interference with our life.And a big thanks to all of you for following us and for showing us your love for the project, it has been great beyond any expectations.And the biggest thank you to Stefanie, for bearing with my control-freak and organizational obsessive manners, \u00a0with my design flaws and my English inconsistencies.\u00a0But also thanks Stefanie form making me reconsider my idea of success:\u00a0doing what you are passionate about and getting reward for it in the long term, feeling like you worked hard at the end of each day, being pleased in how you spent your time, but most of all creating a human connection that will help you raise your personal bar.\u00a0\u00a0_Hey! we\u2019re not done yet! But stay tuned! Many more collaborations and explorations about data, drawings and humanity will happen, we promise!In the meantime, if you miss us you can watch our keynote talk at Eyeo, and listen to us on Data Stories and on the Policiviz Podcast!_p.s. and a shameful revelation. Of course we decided the last week of Dear Data was about \u201cgoodbyes\u201d to include a special goodbye to Dear Data in our postcard. Guess what I forgot to add? \u00a0""}]"

I\u2019m just including this here because I\u2019m pretty proud of our achievement). Then, there were \u2018I am dreading saying goodbye\u2019 goodbyes, where you say goodbye in advance to prepare yourself for the big, serious final goodbyes where you know that something is changing and ending for good. You know: the scariest goodbyes of all.I had two of these big serious goodbyes this week. The first final goodbye was to my Brixton studio where I spent over two years (ending because my old studiomate got a PROPER job, damn him) so after I packed up all of my stuff and stood in the space on my own I looked around and gave it a silent goodbye before heading off to my new workspace in Peckham.The second final goodbye was, of course, Dear Data. I was at home for Sunday evening, wrapping up the weekend with a sore head (due to the pub crawl) and knew I would have no other goodbyes to track, so carefully noted down this last goodbye in my little notebook: a quiet end to a year of data-gathering.I liked drawing this last postcard, because I feel as though I have progressed since our first week when we were so nervous to put pen and pencil on paper. I feel like I\u2019m an old hand at drawing postcards now. And maybe that\u2019s a sign that this project should definitely come to an end: it feels second nature, instead of something new and fresh. A year is a good run, and I\u2019m both sad and happy it\u2019s over.\u00a0I can\u2019t believe Giorgia forgot to say goodbye to Dear Data in her postcard! But I like how we both had other big goodbyes this week as well: Giorgia moving apartments, me moving studios. We are both starting afresh in many ways at the end of this project.\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""Epilogue"", ""content"": ""Ending our weekly tracking felt so uneventful\u2026.we were finished, just like that, and then we were back to normal. It\u2019s funny how big parts of one\u2019s life don\u2019t end with a bang but with a whimper. For weeks after I would go about my day always having this niggling feeling in the back of my mind that I needed to be doing something, that I needed to be tracking something, and this took at least a month and a half to shake.Reflecting upon this past year, I\u2019m proud of what Giorgia and I have done. This project feels so big that it\u2019s easy to forget that this was meant to just be a side project squeezed in amongst the \u2018proper\u2019 work to pay the bills. Instead, this \u2018side\u2019 project has become our biggest project of the year, which is an exciting reminder that often when you make the time for a side project it has the potential to impact the future course of your life and career. When we started this we never expected that this project would bring so many new opportunities for us and for that we are truly grateful.\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""So, on that note of gratitude, I\u2019d like to end by thanking some very important people:"", ""content"": ""\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""Thank you to everyone"", ""content"": "" (and there are many, so many) whose support and kind words have helped us carry on with this project in times where we didn\u2019t feel very sure-footed, when we were nervous, when we wondered whether what we were doing was interesting, or worthwhile, or meaningful. And a very special thank you to those of you who have been a sounding board for the progression of the project: there are so many of you, but you know who you are, and we thank you so much for your good, patient advice.\u00a0""}, {""header"": ""Thank you to my friends and my family"", ""content"": "" who have had to put up with me continually tapping on my phone at the most inopportune of times and for allowing me to include you as part of these postcards. I\u2019ve often said this, but the things that we count and include in the postcards are inherently the parts of life that are most important to us, so I\u2019m pleased to have a permanent postcard reminder that I am surrounded and supported by an amazing crew.\u00a0And a big thank you to my husband, who has seen weekends torn asunder by his stressed-out wife drawing failed postcard after failed postcard in a nest of pens and paper at the dining room table, who has been tracked unknowingly (yet has been surprisingly cool with it), has had to hear me talk about Dear Data from dusk to dawn (and has always been very polite in how he tells me to maybe give it a rest sometimes :) ), and yet, for how much a project like this can impact our domestic routines, he has never been frustrated, but has always been supportive. I hope I\u2019ve made him proud.\u00a0And last but not least: thanks so much to Giorgia! We started this project not really knowing each other, and now we are in continual and constant contact in a way that won\u2019t be ending any time soon as we develop and expand this project into a book.This year of sending postcards to each other has made me realise both how similar and how different Giorgia and I are, and in a way, it\u2019s the differences that have been the most impactful: we definitely don\u2019t agree on everything, not by any means! But I\u2019m starting to realise that a good collaboration isn\u2019t one where the two people involved always agree, but is one with healthy debate back-and-forth, where Giorgia\u2019s different viewpoints in our collaboration has helped me see the world differently that I would normally see it. Thank you, Giorgia, for helping this slacker, last-minute, procrastinating freelancer learn the joy of getting things done early and organising :)\u00a0Dear Data is a transformative project that completely changed our direction for the next year, and we couldn\u2019t have done this on our own, but only as this pair of two. Here\u2019s to another year of lots of disagreements (and agreements too), lots of emojis, and lots and lots of drawing.""}, {""header"": ""Thanks everyone! Stef"", ""content"": """"}]"
